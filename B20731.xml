            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F either Author or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may tend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend any Treatise, I might take occasion from both these respects to speak to the <hi>high</hi> commendation of all these three ensuing Treatises; the <hi>Authors</hi> of them being such as whose commendations are in the gates of all the daughters of <hi>Zion,</hi> and therefore need not Epistles of Commendation from any others. The Name of Mr. <hi>John Cotton</hi> (the Author of the two former) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a precious Ointment powred forth; and although his

            <p>And as for the <hi>Matter</hi> which they do treat of, 'tis the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:199237:7"/>of <hi>Peace</hi> both <hi>Spirituall, viz.</hi> of a beleeving soul with the <hi>Lord</hi> in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, as in the first Treatise: and <hi>Ecclesiasticall, viz.</hi> between the Brethren and Churches of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Congregationall way,</hi> as in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: and also <hi>Politicall, viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Magistrates and people in point of <hi>power</hi> and <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matters belonging to the first Table, as in the third Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise. How well these things are here spoken unto, I shall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave to the godly and learned Readers to judge.</p>
            <p>I shall only desire to give a brief account of the publishing of them to the world, that the Reader may undoubtedly assure himself that these are neither spurious Copies, nor surreptitiously put forth.</p>
            <p>The Treatise of the <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> having been taken from
<pb facs="tcp:199237:8"/>the Authors mouth in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was afterward presented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him with desire of his perusal and emendation of it; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done (and indeed the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linings of his owne hand doe plainly testifie his correcting of it) he delivered back, not long before his death, into the hands of a Gentleman, (one of the Church in <hi>Boston</hi> there) who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming over hither, and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to return, left it with me to take order for the Printing of it.</p>
            <p>That of the <hi>Queries</hi> I had from the Reverend <hi>Author</hi> himself (my most Honoured friend) in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from him, with liberty (if it might be thought meet) of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of it: At my coming over from that Country (which was about a year before his death) he delivered unto me the same for substance, but in another <hi>Form, viz.</hi> in 12 <hi>Propositions,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:199237:8"/>therefore did then expresse his unwillingness to yield to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of them (being moved thereunto by a Reverend Elder then present with us) by reason (as he said) they were set down by way of Propositions; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the Lord having direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to mould them into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther model (turning the twelve Propositions into eleven Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) he was pleased to send them over unto me as here they are presented. He was a man of peace, of a very sweet spirit, and had a speciall faculty of composing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the judgements of Brethren: and thus much I shall crave liberty to testifie of him, that, beside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the multiplicity of occasions which was constantly upon him, he was not without care about the <hi>Peace</hi> and welfare of the Churches abroad; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his so vast a distance
<pb facs="tcp:199237:9"/>in body from the Churches and Saints in his Native Countrey, yet he had great thoughts of <hi>heart</hi> for the <hi>Division</hi> of his Brethren here, being seriously studious how to compose and heale their breaches: He hath sometimes said unto me being privately toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <q>
                  <hi>Brother I perceive there is a great</hi> gravamen <hi>which the one party is much offended at with the other, I pray let us study how we may ease and remove it.</hi>
               </q> From that solicitous care it was that he drew up these 11 <hi>Queries,</hi> unto which (may it be without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) I shall be bold to add one more to make up the number e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and round, the which I doe presume that our Reverend and honoured friend would not have been averse unto, had he been on earth, to have been consulted withall.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:199237:9"/>
            <p> The third and last Treatise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>The Result of a Synod at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> (as 'tis stiled by the Copy come to my hands) was lately sent over unto me from a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Friend (one that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at that Assembly) desiring mee earnestly (intimating also that 'twas not his owne desire only) to procure the Printing of it, as conceiving it might prove very usefull for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent season.</p>
            <p>Now these three little Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses being in mine hand (through providence) together, and each of them somewhat too small to put forth severally, I was the more willing (especially appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending them not to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heterogeniall) to joyne in one small Volume, and as they came from one and the same place, so to send them forth as
<pb facs="tcp:199237:10"/>Companions together: and oh that the presence and blessing of the Spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> may go along with them, making them usefull and profitable unto the Readers or Hearers of them!</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His blessed Servant of God, <hi>Steven,</hi> being called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count concerning what he had sayd touching Jesus Christ his destroying the Temple, it is the scope of his whole discourse thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Chapter, to justifie the doctrine that he had taught; that though Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> should destroy that place, yet in so teaching he taught not blasphemy. And this he doth (in way
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:199237:19"/>of an holy H story or Narration) make evident in the first place from the sweet communion which their Fathers had with God, before either Temple or Tabernacle was built; and if so, then he would not have them look at it as unsafe for them, or as an utter ruine to Religion, if that both the Temple and the Ordinances of the Temple were destroyed in themselves, and fulfilled in him. And first, the passages of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> communion with God, <hi>Steven</hi> doth relate and maintaine, before any of <hi>Moses</hi> his Customes were knowne.</p>
            <p>God did effectually call him, which call he did also obey (<hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, 4.) though as yet he knew no Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>God giveth him a tryal of his faith, wherein he found <hi>Abrabam</hi> faithfull, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7. God promised to give him the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for a possession, but he gave him not a foots breadth. He promised to give it unto his seed, when as yet he had no Child: and when God gave him seed, yet they should sojourn in a strange Land, and be in bondage 400 years.</p>
            <p>God gave him <hi>the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:199237:19"/>in the words of the Text; and <hi>Abrabam</hi> in the strength of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God begate <hi>Isaac,</hi> and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised him according to Gods directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all this before <hi>Moses</hi> gave any Ordinances unto them to keep, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either Temple or Tabernacle was built. From hence we have heard, <hi>That the soule may have very spirituall and gracious communion with God, before it partake in Church-fellowship, or in any Seale thereof;</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was throughly tryed, before he had the Seale of Church-Covenant given him. We heard also this propounded, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> is the words of the Text, that <hi>God gave unto Abraham the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision;</hi> which Doctrine doth imply in it four principall parts, all of them serving to clear <hi>Stevens</hi> meaning, and to prove his scope.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The <hi>Author</hi> and manner of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing it, <hi>God gave:</hi> so it was by <hi>gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 The <hi>Articles</hi> of it; and they are to be inquired into.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The <hi>Confederates;</hi> and they are expressed, <hi>God</hi> on the one side, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his <hi>seed</hi> on the other side.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The <hi>Seale</hi> of it, <hi>Circumcision,</hi> which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:199237:20"/>was the Seale of Church-Covenant.</p>
            <p>These four parts doe yeeld unto us so many Notes. The first of them was formerly spoken unto in the last point formerly handled: Now for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third parts, to wit, the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,</hi> we comprehend them both in this one Note.</p>

               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles be, is not here mentioned, but <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. they be (for to speak of Circumcision before a Covenant, it is but a seale to a blank) where the Lord expresseth himselfe, thus saying, <hi>I will establish my Covenant between me, and thee, and thy seed after thee in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for an everlasting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and unto thy seed after thee.</hi> As for other parts of the Covenant,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:199237:20"/>they were more properly unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himselfe, as to be <hi>exceeding fruitfull,</hi> to be <hi>the father of many Nations,</hi> those things were more peculiarly proper unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> though they have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and universall use and force in all the faithfull, whom the Lord doth make fruitfull, and giveth them a naile in his Tabernacle. In the Covenant these three things are implyed.</p>
            <p n="1">1 God gave himselfe to be a <hi>God</hi> unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his seed. This is such an Argument as the strength and wisdome of men and Angels cannot unfold: It is a Catechisme point, and by way of Catechisme to be opened (as the Lord hath revealed it) I mean, plainly and familiarly.</p>
            <p n="2">2 God did receive <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed to be his people, this is implied and necessarily inferred by the Rule of Relatives; for if God doe give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a God unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his seed, and doth not expresly prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of his seed, that they should give up themselves to be his people; then it must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty follow, that the Lord will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to receive them to be a people
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199237:21"/>unto himselfe, and prevent them in that grace, and so he will performe both his owne part of the Covenant, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> part also; according to what we read, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6, 7, 8. when as they were in a Land of Idols, and the Lord lifted up his hand to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed them there, yet he remembred and wrought for his own Name sake: so that though they were far off, yet the Lord (to make good his Covenant) brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and so from one Covenant to another; by all which things it doth appear, that the Lord will keep our part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant also; and this is necessarily implyed, in that he promiseth to be a God unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his seed; and there is no exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esse Restipulation pre-required on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part. We see this likewise held forth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.1.13. where the Lord entreth into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant with them, in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> besides the Covenant which he made with them in <hi>Horeb,</hi> and in this Covenant he doth establish them to be a people unto himselfe, as well as give himself to them to be thrir God, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:199237:21"/>them, to circumcise the outward man, even the foreskin of their Children, so he will also circumcise them, taking possession of them, and circumcising their hearts, and taking away the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynesse of them, and so fit them to be a Temple for himselfe to dwell in.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Lord in this Covenant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the chiefest of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, even the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to be the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and surety of the Covenant, and unto him doe all the Promises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: so the Apostle doth expound it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.— and so by him are all the Promises and blessings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant conveyed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his seed (his faithfull seed) all the world over, and therefore he is called the <hi>Mediator of a better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 7.22. meaning of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. These three things doe containe the sum of the Covenant of Grace, and of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and would therefore be plainly discovered unto Christians, as,</p>
            <p n="1">1 What is the meaning of this, that God gave himselfe unto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 How doth he take <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, and make them his people.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:199237:22"/> 3 How doth he take Jesus Christ and make him the Surety of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between them both; for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is established, and so is a sure, firm and everlasting Covenant. Now in this gift that God gave himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham,</hi> observe three things.</p>

            <p n="1">1 That God doth give Himselfe, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, the whole Nature of God and all the Persons: the God-head, with all the Attributes of that Nature, and all the Offices of those persons; for it is not a confused God that vanisheth away in a generall imagination, but God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly considered, in his Persons, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, Properties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the Lord giveth himselfe to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his seed, <hi>I will be a father unto you,</hi> 2. Cor. 6.18. and that is not spoken unto the <hi>Jewes</hi> onely, but unto all the <hi>Israel</hi> of God: He giveth the Son also, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. And for the Holy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:199237:22"/>Spirit, <hi>Jo.</hi> 16.7.13. <hi>Isa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>This is my Covenant with them saith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words that I have put into thy mouth shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</hi> &amp;c. And this is it which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle also saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 6. Thus the Lord giveth himselfe unto his Servants from one Generation to another. If therefore the Lord, God the Father give himselfe, he will not be wanting to draw his people unto the Son, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.44. and what is the chief businesse and work that the Son hath to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us? No man can have fellowship with the Father, but he must have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with Jesus Christ, so our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himselfe saith, <hi>John</hi> 14.6. <hi>No man can come unto the Father, but by me:</hi> This therefore the Lord Jesus Christ will doe for all the elect seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> he will open their eyes to see, that the Father did not draw them to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or utter desolation (though at first that be their greatest fear) but unto salvation by him. This hath he promised to doe, and if it be the work of the Spirit of God to establish us both in the Father and the Son, then will he <hi>convince the world of sin, of righteousnesse,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:199237:23"/>and of judgement,</hi> John 16.8, to 11. and so will establish our hearts in the comforn of the Lord our God; and this is that which the Apostle prayeth for the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> Chap. 3.16. Hence it cometh to passe, that what the Lord would have us to doe, he is present by his Spirit to teach us, and to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us, and so to doe it for us. All these things doth the Lord work for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and for his Elect seed: So that look what is meet for a Father to do, or for a Brother to doe, or for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God to doe, that will the Lord doe unto his elect ones; and so he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all his attributes, and they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven God himselfe; and therefore when <hi>Moses</hi> desired to see his glory, and he desired it from the grace that God had shewed him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his Name before him, <hi>Jehovah, Jehovah, strong, mercifull, and gracious,</hi> &amp;c. Thus doth the Lord give himselfe, and all the Persons in the God-head (as they are truly called) and Attributes, they are no more, nor no other then God himselfe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And as God himself is implyed; so when God is given by Covenant, all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:199237:23"/>the Ordinances and Creatures, and works of God are given also, for so it was in all Covenants of old time; when <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> maketh a Covenant with <hi>Ahab</hi> King of Israel, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.4. then <hi>I am as thou art, and my people as thy people, and my Horses as thy Horses,</hi> and all that he hath is for <hi>Ahabs</hi> service, as the King goeth, so goeth his strength; so thus it comes to passe, that if the Lord of Hoasts be for us, and give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto us, then also he gives unto us his Eternall <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> and whatsoever he hath wrought for the salvation of his Elect; He hath not so dealt with any Nation <hi>(Psal.</hi> 147.20.) but only with the Israel of God, unto them hath he given his Laws and shewed them his judgements: And for his <hi>Creatures,</hi> they are all given to be for his People, to whom he hath given himself. If God be a God unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> then shall all Gods people be for him, <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> shall blesse him, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Eshcot,</hi> and <hi>Mature,</hi> shall be Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates with him; the Sun, Moon, and Stars shall fight in their courses for the people of God; the Sea shall give way to passe through it on dry ground,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:199237:24"/>
               <hi>What ailed you ye streams of Jordan to goe back?</hi> Why, all the Creatures of God must stoop unto the people of God w<seg rend="sup">n</seg> he is in Covenant with them. This is that which the Lord promiseth unto his people, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.18. to 22. when the Lord shall marry them to him in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. This is the large gift of Gods Covenant. Nay, and which is wonderfull and beyond all comprehension, when I say, all the Creatures and Ordinances of God are ours, the very expression of the phrase doth imply that the Lord giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be the staffe and strength of them; so that you shall see the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God in them, he will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give a man wife and children, and Ordinances, and providences, but he will be in all these, and blesse his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the enjoyment of them all, so as that they shall enjoy God in all. <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.5, 6. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.</hi> He saw the Lord in what he did enjoy, and when he had any thing it was in God, &amp; when he wanted any thing it was supplyed in him. The like did <hi>Jacob</hi> find, when his brother <hi>Esau</hi> came against him with 400 men, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:199237:24"/>the Lord turned him from the fierce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse of his wrath; here was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Lord gave him the mouth, and arms, and tears of his brother <hi>Esau:</hi> what saith <hi>Jacob</hi> to all this? <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.10. <hi>I have seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God.</hi> He saw the power and mercy of God in changing the countenance of his elder brother: and that is it which sweetneth all that a man doth enjoy, the loving-kindnes of God in all, is the blessing of all; and this likewise doth <hi>Jacob</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.5. <hi>These are the Children which God hath gratiously given thy Servant;</hi> and so he looked at them as Gods wives, and children, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Cattell; and this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life of the Covenant of Grace, when as the Lord is wrapped up in all his blessings, when as he giveth himselfe, and in himselfe his Christ, &amp; in Christ <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and all things unto his Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. This is the maine thing given, God himselfe, the God of the Covenant, his Persons, Nature, Ordinances, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and now <hi>Abraham</hi> is made the Lord of the world: and so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:199237:25"/>doth interpret it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. the <hi>Promise that he should be Heire of the world,</hi> &amp;c. and this is that which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did receive in receiving the Lord to be his God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In the <hi>Order</hi> of giving the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, there is something to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p n="1">1 God giveth first, and not the Creature, it was not <hi>Abraham</hi> that gave unto God first, for which of all the Creatures shall offer a Covenant unto the Mighty God? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. the Lord hath the preheminence in giving, for what should <hi>Abraham</hi> give unto God, if God give not something unto him first? He is the first giver.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He is also the first thing in order that is given; for, doth he give the world first, or Ordinances first? or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other spirituall or temporall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings first? No doubtlesse, the Lord is the first thing that he giveth by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and with himselfe all things else also, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. And there is the precedency of Jesus Christ, he is given, and in him all spirituall blessings, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.3. and this for the order of Nature in giving the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:199237:25"/>Covenant: not Obedience first, nor Faith first, nor any thing else first, but himselfe is <hi>Donum primum &amp; primarium,</hi> and in him, all his goodnesse, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3 For the <hi>Manner</hi> of giving; in that he giveth himselfe, there is implyed both the freedome and eternity of the gift, firmnesse therefore and that unto eternity. In that he giveth himselfe, it must of necessity be done freely; for what can any Creature give to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase God? If a man could give thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of worlds they were not enough to purchase or redeem one soule; and if he had millions of worlds to give, what were they all to purchase so great a gift as God himselfe is? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must needs be of free gift, for the Creature can doe nothing to prevent God. God indeed may give with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to receive back againe, as God doth require this of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he should have no other Gods before him, <hi>&amp;c. Gen.</hi> 17.1. But though <hi>Abraham</hi> shall performe this and all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements in an Evangelicall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet God himselfe doth undertake in this Covenant to be the Author and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:199237:26"/>finisher of this his faith and obedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. And this doth argue the marvelous freedome of the Covenant of Grace, for the Lord offereth it out of his grace without the foresight of faith or works, for he undertaketh to give both will and deed of his good pleasure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</p>

Here is the freeness of Gods Covenant, in that the Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himself first, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32 40. You may speak of Conditions in this kind, but the Lord doth undertake both for his own part and for our parts also: for as the Covenant is free, so the Lord will freely maintaine and preserve all his Elect, and all from the immutable nature of God; it is not possible that God should lye, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6.

            <p n="1">1 By a Spirit of <hi>Bondage,</hi> whereby he cutteth off the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from all worldly intanglements and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; thus God took <hi>Abraham,</hi> and brought him from beyond the Flood, and so doth he take men off from their Countreys and Fathers houses, he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates them from all such things that he might draw them unto himselfe: Thus he dealt with the Children of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and called them to be a singular people unto himselfe, and yet but in a Covenant of works, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6, 7, 8.

Now by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:199237:28"/>this bondage the Lord first setteth home unto the Consciences of men the weight and danger of their sins, and it is the usuall manner of God to give a Covenant of Grace by leading men first into a Covenant of worke (as it is his constant manner to work by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This may Hypocrites reach unto in their judgements, so as that they may be convinced, that they have neither root within them, nor branch growing upon them, and yet in the mean while they may not come unto a Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, but hereby also the Lord u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to prepare his people.

The same Spirit is also called the <hi>Comforter,</hi> whom Jesus Christ hath promised to send, <hi>John</hi> 16.7, 8, 9. <hi>If I depart, I will send you the Comforter, and when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, of righteousnesse, and of judgement.: Of sin because they beleeve not in me.</hi> This the holy ghost convinceth men of, to be the greatest misery of the soule, that they have not beleeved upon Jesus Christ. And look as a Talent of gold or some weighty mettall falling into a Vessell of water, dasheth out all that is in the vessell to make room for it selfe: So
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:199237:31"/>the Lord Jesus Christ coming into the soule, dasheth out all watry confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and maketh room for himselfe, so as that you may say the Eternall God is there; and in very deed, because the heart of man is not onely like unto water, but is hard and stony, therefore the Spirit of God cometh like fire, and melteth the iron stone of the heart, and softneth it into flesh, that now the soul is utterly at a losse not onely in regard of his sins, but in regard of his best works also, and is most of all convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of his unbeliefe. Now the Holy Spirit of God being thus shed abroad into the heart, at the very first entrance of it into the soule, as it doth chiefly convince the soule of Unbelief, so</p>
            <p n="2">2 The same Spirit worketh faith in the soule to yeeld himselfe unto the Lord, and the soule being emptied of himselfe, now the Holy Ghost hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Faith to receive the Lord Jesus Christ; and this is a true saving work though the soule thinketh it selfe in a very sad condition, that he should so long live without beleeving in Jesus Christ. But he is cleerly convinced what his case is, and how vaine his best
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:199237:31"/>works are; and he lyeth under this work not onely in his judgement, but in his heart; he now freely submitteth unto the will of God. So that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God becometh unto the soul, not onely as a Spirit of <hi>burning</hi> to consume all that is like stubble, but doth also melt the iron-stone of the heart, and softneth it into flesh, that the word may take deep impression in it: Now there is room for Jesus Christ, now faith is wrought there, and now a soule can plead with God by faith in prayer; he seeth there is no former Covenant that he can plead, nor any righteousnesse of his owne, but such as Hypocrites will quarrell for, and rise up to maintaine, as they did against <hi>John Baptist,</hi> plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Covenant and their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse; with these things a poore soule is not satisfied, <hi>but unto you that feare my name shall the Sun of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse arise with healing in his wings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. Herein is implyed such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent fear that dare not disaffect this kind of yeeldingnesse to the Son. In the old Testament it is called <hi>Fear,</hi> in the new Testament it is more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Faith;</hi> yet the Apostle saith,

               <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Be not high-minded, but fear,</hi> whereby he provoketh them to live by Faith; and indeed it is that, whereby the soule doth yeeld unto the Lord: and this is indeed our <hi>Effectuall Calling;</hi> the Spirit of God taking possession in our hearts, and working this faith in us, whereby we submit unto the Lord. This is that faith in Jesus Christ that maketh us one with Christ, for our ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall calling bringeth us to be one with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>God is faithfull by whom ye are called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> This fellowship or communion standeth in two things.</p>

               </label> I pray you consider it: If it be a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:199237:33"/>condition, it is to some good Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or other, some good work or other of the Spirit of God in the heart of a Christian: Was this work wrought before Conversion or after? Every Christian knoweth, that all workes wrought before Conversion are but drosse and dung, to apply Promises to such works, were indeed to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a sandy foundation. What say you then to works after Conversion? All works after Conversion are fruits of Faith, and if they proceed from faith, then faith went before, then a mans faith was not built upon a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall promise, how is it possible that it should, when as all works after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version are fruits of faith, or else they are no true sanctification, then faith went before in order of Nature, and so was not built upon works, but works upon it. And therefore all our best Divines doe carry it thus; That faith closeth with Christ upon a Promise of free grace,<note place="margin">Justit. l. 3. c. 2. s. 29.</note> otherwise (as saith <hi>Calvin)</hi> my faith would alwayes be trembling and wavering as my works be.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:199237:33"/>God in Christ <hi>reconciling the world unto himselfe, 2 Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. The word is it may be spoken outwardly unto all Christians, but if God doe set it home particularly unto any soule, that man receives this gift of God, &amp; it is made his own: first he beleeveth this Promise of free grace, and then afterward come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promises that doe bear witnesse unto the right application of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise unto the soule: but I am first buil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> upon a Promise of free-grace, or else there is no true closing with Jesus Christ. Well then, being thus united unto Christ, from this Union with Christ, do flow all other blessings and benefits of the Covenant of grace; and from hence springeth <hi>Communion with Christ</hi> in all spirituall blessings that the Lord hath wrought for us in him, and they are, two of them <hi>Relative blessings,</hi> as they are called by Divines, and two of them <hi>Positive blessings:</hi> The two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are laid up in Gods owne hand, and are not created in us as the other two are.</p>
            <p n="1">1 For the <hi>Relative blessings,</hi> they are</p>

            <p> And they spring immediately <hi>(si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul &amp; semel)</hi> from the former Union with Christ, for as soon as ever the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is in our hearts, and hath wrought faith, that we doe not spurne against Jesus Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st in us, and we are now become the Sons of God as Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is.</p>
            <p>Look as in a mans first naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as soon as ever <hi>Adam</hi> doth live, there is an heir of <hi>Adam,</hi> even so soon as the soul liveth: So it is in this new spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall birth, as soon as the Holy Ghost cometh and hath wrought this faith, now is the seed of God in us, and the life of Christ, and the Spirit of God, and now are we the Sons of God, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.12. Immediately upon this Union with Christ we are Sons by <hi>Adoption,</hi> and as we are Adopted, so likewise our sins are now imputed unto Christ, and his righteousnesse unto us, and so our persons are justified. For how and when was <hi>Adams</hi> sin imputed unto us? <hi>Psa.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold I was shapen in iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. so soon as ever there was life, it was the life of <hi>Adam,</hi> now the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> sin falleth immediately upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:199237:34"/>the soule. So when we doe receive Christ by this liv ng faith, having the life of Christ in us, we have the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ also imputed to us: for what doth the Child in the womb, though it doth neither good nor evill, but is meerly passive, yet sinfull it is, and a Child of <hi>Adam.</hi> So also in this our Regeneration, the soule acteth not, but onely receiveth Christ by that faith which the Lord hath wrought in it, whereby also it is made capable of the priviledge of Adoption, and so the Lord accounteth us his Children, and imputeth the righteousnesse of his Son unto us, whereby we are justified. These things doe dwell in Gods bosome, and the meaning of them is afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed unto the soule, but communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated they are, both that of <hi>Adoption,</hi> and this of <hi>Justification,</hi> by the gift of faith wrought in us. But we are still up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first worke of Conversion, wherein a Christian is onely passive and receptive, and truly it must needs be so in the first work of God upon us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Now for the Positive blessings that are wrought in us, they are:</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:199237:35"/>
               <item>1 Sanctification.</item>
               <item>2 Glorification.</item>
            </list>
            <p>When we are called, then are we san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, then are we glorified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. As in our naturall conception, as soon as ever the Child liveth, <hi>Adams</hi> sin is first imputed, and then there is a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in it to carry it captive unto sin, and to make it backward unto any goodnesse: so when the life of Christ is dispensed unto the soule, now the Lord cometh to convey with it Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and in it pardon of sin, and then there is a pronenesse in a justified person to be lively in duty. <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit,</hi> and by faith our hearts come to be purified, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. and the same Spirit quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth us unto holy duties; so that we live, yet not we, but Christ liveth in us, yea the Spirit sanctifying draweth us into an holy Confederacy to serve God in family, Church, &amp; Common-wealth; and this sanctification groweth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth more and more; for as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Nature springeth from the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> unrighteousnesse, so doth sanctification spring from the imputation of Christs righteousnesse
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:199237:35"/>and thence floweth a pronenesse unto that which is good, and a backwardnes unto that which is evill; this is San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>
            <p n="2">The other Positive gift is Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which we read of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. This the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> mentioneth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. as that whereunto we are called, — and in truth he hath begun the work from the time that he first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to call and sanctifie us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. From the very first time that God worketh upon the soule gratiously, there is a glorious work in that soul, and others may see it though himselfe seeth nothing that he hath received.</p>
            <p>Thus we see the second branch of the Doctrine opened, how the Lord doth receive <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, preparing them by a spirit of <hi>bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> and of <hi>burning,</hi> and then savingly by the inhabitation of the blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the same Spirit begetting Faith, we are alive in Jesus Christ, and so come to be adopted and justified in him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the same Faith which at first onely receiveth Adoption and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, doth now begin to stir a little, and to breath forth into gratious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:199237:36"/>and some holy mourning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth now to put forth such works as the Holy Ghost carryeth the soul an end in, working all our works in us and for us.</p>
            <p>Now for the third and last part of the Doctrine, the Lord took the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed to be the Mediator of this Covenant, unto whom all the Promises were made, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16.</p>

            <p>First, by receiving Jesus Christ the Son of the Virgin Mary, to be one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with the second in Trinity, hereby laying a ground of a firm Mediation between God and us: for now cometh Jesus Christ to be of Gods Nature, and therefore he wilbe faithfull unto God, and of our nature, and therefore he wil be compassionate towards us.

               </gap>diation, to wit, this personall Union betweene Jesus Christ and the Father, which maketh up a firm and everlasting communion between God himselfe, and Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by Gods giving him to be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:199237:36"/>a Covenant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.6. <hi>I will give thee for a Covenant of the people,</hi> &amp;c. That is, to be a Mediator of this Covenant.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To receive from God all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and gratious gifts, whatsoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to a King, Priest, and Prophet, all things he receiveth from the hand of the Father, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. <hi>For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullnesse dwell,</hi> thus he becometh a plentifull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: And as the Lord gave him to be a Covenant, so he giveth him also to worke all things needfull for our Redemption: partly by his Passion, and obedience unto the death of the Cross, and partly by fulfilling the whole Law, all righteousnesse for us. The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ did fully accomplish what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was requisite for him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish in his owne Person.</p>
            <p n="2">2 He doth perform all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Application of this redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto our soules; and to this end, he it is that sheddeth abroad his Spirit into our hearts, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. &amp; 16.7. and when this blessed Spirit cometh, he applyeth unto the soule all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious redemption of Jesus Christ, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him and all the fruits of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:199237:37"/>and by working all those blessed works that the soul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Thus hath the Lord made him a compleat Mediatour of this holy Covenant, and whatsoever we receive, we receive it from him; for unto him first as the head of the Church are all blessings given, and unto us <hi>all Promises in him are Yea and in him Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. for though Christ be not a sinner in his owne persons, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his Members, he is many times lost in them, though not in himselfe; and poor in them, though not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; for us therefore he receiveth the Promises of God, and that is the great security of them, that they are laid up safe in him, and belong unto us if we have Union with the head; and in him we perform whatsoever God requireth, whether we Pray, or Preach, or hear, we doe all in the Name of Christ, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:199237:37"/>forth in his strength and power, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. Thus is the Lord Jesus Christ a firm Surety of the better Covenant, <hi>Stablished upon better Promises,</hi> Heb. 8.6.</p>

            <p>In the Covenant of works, the Lord offereth himselfe as a Father, his Son as a Redeemer, his Spirit as a Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but this upon a condition of works, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods but me;</hi> and <hi>If they shall keep his Lawes and obey his voyce, then they shall be a peculiar trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure unto him above all people,</hi> Exod. 19.5, 6.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:199237:40"/>Christ was but a Conditionall Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer unto them; they had onely gifts of Tongues, and utterance, and wisdome, and discerning of spirits, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith; which things are not that Sanctification which is a fruit of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith, but onely such gifts as doe sanctifie them unto the work of the Ministry perhaps, or Magistracy, and fit them for houshold Government, or the like; and so much Positive work there is in them as doth make them in some measure fit for the work or service they are called unto.</p>
            <p>For a little more explaining of this, Is it the same with that Sanctification which is in Gods Children? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. All the men in the world are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two ranks, Godly or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, Righteous or Wicked; of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men two sorts, some are notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, others are Hypocrites: Of Hypocrites two sorts (and you shall find them in the Church of God) some are washed Swine, others are Goats.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The <hi>Swine</hi> are those of whom our Saviour Christ saith, <hi>That they returne unto their wallowing in the mire;</hi> like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these are such men who at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:199237:40"/>of some Sermon have been stomach sick of their sins, and have rejected their wicked courses, but yet the swines heart remaineth in them, as a Swine when he cometh where the puddle is, will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily lye down in it: so will these men wallow in the puddle of uncleannesse when their conscience is not pricked for the present: But these are a gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser kind of Hypocrites.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is another sort that goe far beyond these, and they are <hi>Goats,</hi> so called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.32, 33. and these are clean Beasts such as chew the cudd, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon Ordinances, and they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the hoofe, they live both in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and particular calling, and will not be idle; they are also fit for sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; what then is wanting? Truly they are not <hi>sheep</hi> all this while, they are but <hi>Goats,</hi> yet a Goat doth loath that which a Swine will readily break into; but where then doe they fall short of the nature of sheep? A diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is, which standeth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in these particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Goat is of a Capricious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and affecteth Eminency, his gate also is stately, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.30. <hi>Agur</hi> reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth

Thus it was with <hi>Jehu,</hi> who in his zeal for God thought to promote himselfe, and herein he will not be perswaded of his sin, and therefore going into crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wayes, he cometh at length to cleave unto the sins of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, you may rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The five foolish <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.2. were all of them <hi>Virgins,</hi> all of them abhorring Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and all go forth to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:199237:41"/>and yet they are foolish and never shall you make them wise, to be all for Christ, onely hearing and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his voyce.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They are of a Rankish nature all of them, specially the old Goats will have an unsavory relish, far from that pleasant sweetnesse that is in a sheep; and herein Hypocrites are greatly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the sheep of Christ, as the Prophet speaketh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.21. and they marre the Pastures with their feet, and will be at length mudling the faire waters of the Sanctuary also; and in your best sanctification they fall far short of a sheep-like frame of spirit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to heare the voyce of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheard, this will not be found in the sanctification of the best Hypocrite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, they may goe far and yet fall away, and this is no Arminianism, but if you search the Scriptures dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, you will find these things to be true.</p>
            <p n="4">4 There is a fourth difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Covenant of works and of grace, in respect of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> Gal. 3.19. <hi>The Law was given and ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediatour. Moses</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:199237:42"/>was a Mediatour according to the works, and this our Saviour telleth the Jewes, <hi>John</hi> 5.45. <hi>You have one that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth you, even Moses in whom ye trust:</hi> And as for Jesus Christ, if he be given to be their Redeemer, it is but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their works, if they shall obey his voyce, but if they shall sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, he will overthrow them body and soule into the nethermost Hell. But now in the Covenant of Grace, Jesus Christ hath <hi>Obtained a more excellent Ministry, to be the Mediator of a better Covenant, established upon better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> Heb. 8.6. Thus we see in this first Use, the difference between the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, and the Covenant of Grace.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:199237:42"/>giveth any thing else accompanying Salvation. He gave us Christ in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Counsel before Election, and so doth he also in our Effectuall Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; not any Grace before Christ, or power to choose whether we will have him or not have him: but he is God, and first giveth himselfe, and with him faith, and so worketh our wills unto himselfe; not otherwise, leaving it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us to choose whether we will have him to be our God or no. Many things in Popery and Arminianisme come to be confuted from hence, and both are utterly rooted out; for in truth they hold forth no more but a Covenant of works: And if we will not grant faith to be the cause of all the blessed gifts of God, they will take it marvelously un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, but they were as good deliver unto us another Gospel; for it is not of Grace, that Faith is given us?</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>3</label> This may also teach the people of God, to bear a gratious respect unto those that are under a Covenant of works, and not forthwith to condemn them, as if there were no hope of their Salvation: For God doth not call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into fellowship with himselfe in a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:199237:43"/>Covenant of Grace, but ordinarily he first bringeth them into a Covenant of works, and casteth them out of doors by a spirit of bondage and of burning, and then bringeth them in by the true door, and Jesus Christ is that doore, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.9. Though the Children of the Faithfull be born under the outward dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, yet if they be not of the Elect seed, they will chose life by their works, and so fall under the Covenant of works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. to 30. So will Professors also, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. yea, the Elect themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Effectuall Calling, will seek life by their works. Hence those that are under a Covenant of works may belong unto the Lord as well as my selfe, pray for them therefore. <hi>Paul</hi> was under a Covenant of workes, <hi>Steven</hi> prayeth for him, and as most conceive, that Prayer was effectuall unto his Conversion, and <hi>Paul</hi> was as dear unto the Lord in his Eternall purpose, as <hi>Steven</hi> himselfe was: And thus <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe speaketh of <hi>Onesimus, He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore departed for a season that he might be received for ever:</hi> So may we say of men under a Covenant of works, the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:199237:43"/>Lord may bring any of them home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe by dashing all his works in pieces, and shewing him the presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Spirit, though the Lord hath melted him formerly in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Preachings, and Hearing, and Sacraments, by a Spirit of burning; yet the Lord will discover that he is but hardened by it into another lump of pride against the Lord his God: And the Lord will also pluck away the caul from their hearts, and then they will have none in Heaven but Christ, nor in the earth in comparison of him, and then the Holy Ghost convinceth them of this sin above all their other sins, that they have not believed on Jesus Christ. Doe not therefore censure any such, as to say there is no likelihood that they should have fellowship with Christ, for if the Lord make them to fall down before him, and to yield up their spirits unto the Lord in holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and feare, these have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived some secret smoking affections (besides a Spirit of burning) which the Lord will not quench.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:199237:47"/>yet it is an easie thing for Christians to abuse their Evidence upon this very ground, and as much upon this ground as upon any: For when Christians come to be really wrought upon, and find themselves discouraged from sin, and so reforme their lives and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to obey the word, and find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort therein (and great consolation many times) in such a case as this, Christians doe much differ upon the point; yet I doe not know any of all the Teachers in the Country, that withdraw their consents from this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that such Sanctification, as is wrought in Hypocrites, though it may reach to great improvements, yet it is no evidence of Justification at all. And it hath been handled in another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and I thinke not without weight of truth; that to distinguish in men between that Sanctification which floweth from the Law, and that which is of the Gospel, is a matter so narrow, that the Angels in Heaven have much adoe to discern who differ: a work fitter for Angels to cut the scantling in it, then for the Ministers of the Gospel, though indeed there be great difference

            <p>You know what was said of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.10. <hi>The Spirit of God came upon him,</hi> and so did it likewise upon <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> acting them mightily in their Administrations; and as they were thus carryed along by the Spirit,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:199237:49"/>so likewise the spirit of bondage will marvelously prevaile with the Sons of men to draw them on to strong works of Reformation, from whence they reap no small Consolation, but think and say (as <hi>Abijah</hi> did) that <hi>the Lord is with them whilst they are with him:</hi> And as sometimes <hi>David</hi> said of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>I believed, therefore I spake,</hi> so the <hi>Israelites</hi> also <hi>(Psal.</hi> 106.12.) <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and sang the praises of the Lord upon the red sea shore,</hi> and yet were they but an Hypocriticall Generation; and if Hypocrites may work Miracles in the name of Christ (as they did, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate with Christ about it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22.) then may a temporary Faith work or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary works in Christianity also: and therefore you shall read (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22.) that there is no fault found with the thorny soile for their want of root, or depth of earth, for the want of both which the stony soile was taxed; but look as it is with the branches of a Vine, what depth of earth the roote hath, they have, it being grafted into the Vine, though they be but branches of the wild Olive, and will bring forth but wild fruit; for though the branch

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:199237:56"/>from that faith which Christ doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey into the soule: Now if the just man live by his faith, whether it be the life of sanctification, or consolation, then no Christian can discerne his santifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be lively, but he must discerne his faith living in it, he must see his faith deriving strength and grace and life from Christ, or else he cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his sanctification to be the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Gospell; for as there can be no true sanctification unlesse there be faith, whereby the person is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and whereby life is received to act in all sanctification; so there can be no knowledge of sanctification, but there must be knowledg of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a mans person is accepted, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by strength is conveyed to sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for if a poore soule be doubtfull of his acceptance with the Lord, he is where hee was, notwithstanding his sanctification, and wanteth comfort, for this doubt remaineth, whether he be accepted or no, which (untill the Lord doe manifest a mans faith unto him by the revelation of the holy Ghost) he is still at a losse in it; for though true sanctification be an evidence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of good Christians; and that ordinarily also: for I would not count it extraordinary, being that which the Lord by his Spirit doth usually reveale unto his people. A reall difference there is both in the Roote and in the Rule, and in the Scope which they ayme at, and so it will appeare to be at the last day. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.23 <hi>Depart from me</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>you workers of iniquity, I never knew you;</hi> though they came and told him that they wrought by faith in him: indeed they stood in some relation to him, but not as members to the head, onely as branches to the vine, which may be cut off, and yet the vine not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:199237:57"/>maimed; but if the members should be cut off any one from another, then is the body maimed, but Christ will not suffer his body to be maimed: but take you never so many branches from the vine, and it is not maimed, but will bring forth more: if therefore there be no more fellowship between Christ &amp; a Christian, than between the branches and the vine, you may take them away and yet not hurt the vine. But wherein should this relation stand? It is very hard to conceive, insomuch that those, who have been most exact and diligent to enquire into it, have professed that it is Angels worke; very hard it is so to distinguish them from Gods owne children, so as not to discomfort poor christians, nor to imbolden hypocrites. Wee must be tender therefore, that the least of Gods children may not want their bread: better leave 99 sheepe, than that one poore stray sheepe should not be sought after; and better an 100 hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites perish, than that one poore Christian should want his portion: and yet it is not meet that hypocrites should allow themselves in the estate and fellowship of the Saints, and yet
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:199237:57"/>alwayes blesse themselves in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condition. If you shall ask a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Root, both of them are partakers of the Holy Ghost; Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites may have a tast, and a poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian will feare that his best fellowship with Christ is but a tast, and that mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold experience maketh good. Wherein then lyeth the difference? Doth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God leave the heart of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite stony and unmelted? It is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with the stony, but not with the thorny soile; for the hearts of some Hypocrites are melted, as iron stones, they may come to melt about their owne estates, through fear, and so all those melt that want not depth of earth, as the thorny soile did not; but mind you, they will grow hard again, as iron or lead will doe after it is melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now look at the Spirit of God when he cometh to work effectually, and he doth not onely melt the heart, but <hi>taketh away the heart of stone, and giveth an heart of fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> for which God hath given it, but dares not rest in it as the ground of his blessednesse. This is the first difference betweene Hypocrites and Gods owne
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:199237:58"/>Servants in the root, though both may work in the name of Christ, yet, as the one is temporary, and the other perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth, so this difference you shall find between common and sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and that not onely when Legall Christians are blasted of God, but even then when they doe most flourish in their profession. The true Faith of the Gospel of Christ is never prefident of his owne strength (though they that have it sometimes be, as <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 26.33, 35.) but it is out of himselfe in Christ, whereas the Legall Christian is confident of his Faith, that he can make use of it to these and these ends which are before him, he thinketh there is no more needfull, but to look up unto Christ, and so his work is done: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as take you the strongest Faith of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> who were grown to such height, that none of the Churches were before them, yet the Apostle doth not think their Faith strong enough, but prayeth for supply of something lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Faith, otherwise when it is at the best, it will warpe: whereas one that hath but a temporary Faith, is confident in the strength of that faith,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:199237:59"/>insomuch that it doth not fear, but to carry an end his profession in a safe course to Gods glory and his owne. Thus we see there is a reall difference between the presence and work of the Spirit in an Hypocrite, and in a Child of God. In particular, we see there is a difference in the Faith which is given to both of them; the one hath confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in himselfe, the other in <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Isa. 26.12, 13. This is the first diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the root of their profession.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is Difference also in the Rule by which they walk, though both seek to the word, and delight in that, you shall not difference them there, yet this difference you shall find in their apprehensions; the one is confident of his comfort that he hath in the word, the other seeth need that the Lord should maintaine his comfort for him, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. <hi>David</hi> prayeth thus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as being sensible that this their comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table frame of spirit would soon faile them, and they would quickly grow liftlesse unto such spirituall works as then they had been about; and this is the nature of true Consolation in Christ, it maketh a man to have recours
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:199237:59"/>unto the Author of it to preserve it. Now though both attend unto the word, yet here they differ, the one hath enough if he can see the Rule, like to the Israelites, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27. they have enough if they have the rule, but a true Christian, attending rightly unto his rule, findeth it farre off from him to walk according to it, unlesse the Lord be pleased so to set it home unto him, as that by his power he may be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an end in obedience unto it: for though he know and see his Rule, yet he wanteth help to rule his heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his rule; otherwise though the rule be streight, yet his walking will be crooked, as a child will write crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though his line be streight: So a Christian man is sensible how his feet and hands will shake when he cometh to walk or doe any thing according to a rule; therefore he doth wholly look unto Christ, as being sensible of his owne inability, unlesse he find help and strength from him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 There is difference also in the scope and End which they aime at; though both aime at the glory of God, yet both cannot attaine unto this, to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:199237:60"/>make the glory of God their last end, but the one of these doe secretly wind about to his owne glory in the end, as <hi>Jehu</hi> doth, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.16. <hi>Come see my zeale that I have for the Lord,</hi> but he bringeth about his owne glory by it: and here is the maine deceit of the work, he seeketh the glory of God in himselfe, and in his owne hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the principall care of Gods owne people, is and ought to be the glory of God in Jesus Christ. But the Hypocrite his chief care is to have it seen that God is glorified by his hand, <hi>Come see the zeale that I have.</hi>

               </label> Yes, but there is a great deceit in it, for many a man will work much, so far as his owne glory is wrapped up in his actions, and like it well so long as God may be glorified in him. But all this while he wanteth those single affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions after the glory of God, though in the hand of another.</p>
            <p>But how then should a man seek to promote the glory of God? If it be the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, that a man seeketh after, he will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:199237:60"/>then rejoyce as much that God may be glorified by his brother, as by himself; and that's the spirit of a true Israelite indeed: So that <hi>the Name of Christ be magnified, it's no matter by whom, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doe rejoyce, yea and will rejoyce,</hi> saith the blessed Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.18. If any man therefore aimeth at Gods glory, then onely when it may be an honour to him in his profession, no thank to him for that; much close work may be found, so long as both are carryed an end together: But if when I hear that my Brother glorifieth God, I could have wished that such a thing had been done or spoken by me, &amp; it is the worse, because it is not done by my hands: if that which is the rich good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to my Brother, be not also my rejoycing, it is because of the core of Hypocrisy in my heart.</p>
            <p>Thus have we seen particularly the difference between legall and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall holinesse.</p>
            <p>We proceed still in the fourth Use, to a fifth Question.</p>
            <p>If Jesus Christ be the first gift that is given to the Children of God, before he giveth right unto Promises, or to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:199237:61"/>me to challenge Promises, yea, before he giveth me any other gifts of his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace: then any soule may ask this Question.</p>

            <p n="1">1 <hi>Before our union with Christ</hi> there is a three-fold use of Promises.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They are of use for <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to teach all the people of God, what great and glorious things are laid up in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> even <hi>the unsearchable riches of Christ,</hi> Eph. 3.8. and this all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God doe hold forth. If the Lord Promise to be your Father, your Husband, your Shepheard, your Head, your Root, if he Promise to be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blessing in the world to you, what ever Promise you read or heare, the Lord sheweth you the <hi>unsearchable rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Christ</hi> and that is no vaine use of Promises, for a man to know by them the great good things that are treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in Jesus Christ by the Father; therefore they are called <hi>great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Promises,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. why so? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they declare the <hi>great and pretious
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:199237:62"/>priviledges and blessings in Jesus Christ:</hi> therefore it is that the Lord will have all his people to looke at him in his word and Promises, and to know what great good he hath in store for all them that trust in him, and seek after him in Jesus Christ. Thus all the Promises of Grace declare his excellency: as <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. So doe all the Promises declare him to be a plentifull Saviour, and a mighty Redeemer of all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p n="2">2 As they are of use for Doctrine, so for <hi>Instruction:</hi> It is good to know them, but Instruction is a further thing, and distinct from Doctrine, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. By Instruction men are taught not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what to know, but what to doe; to know and see whither they should resort for the enjoyment of all those pretious blessings that God hath laid up in Jesus Christ; and this is a preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous use of the Promises, that by them the soule should be thus instructed whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to goe for life and salvation, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.22. <hi>Look unto me and be you saved, all the ends of the earth.</hi> Here is a direction to me before I know whither to look, I doe not onely see great things, and so
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:199237:62"/>vanish away, but I am directed to look and be saved; thus are we taught of God likewise by his blessed Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Repent and be baptized,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the Promise is unto you,</hi> &amp;c. Thus we are taught by the Promises whither to look for life and salvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Promises serve also for <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,</hi> as the Scripture last alleadged holdeth forth: <hi>For so many blessings as you see propounded in the Promises, so many invitations are there to provoke mens soules to come unto Christ;</hi> as old <hi>Jacob</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times provoked his Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.1, 2. so saith the Lord to the Sons of men in his Promises, <hi>Why stand ye gazing</hi> in the want of this and that blessing? Is there not pardon of sin, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of blessings in Jesus Christ? Thus is the soul exhorted, not onely to look for mercy, but not to rest till he may enjoy it. Though it be not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises that can by their owne power carry men an end, yet this is the end to which God giveth them, to stir up the Sons of men, not to rest in beholding the good things in the Promises, but to exhort them to provoke themselves and one another, to look after the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:199237:63"/>Lord; thus did the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and testified to them of the free grace of God in his Promises, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. and indeed the Promises are strong grounds of Exhortation to stir up the spirits of all Gods people to look to Jesus Christ, and to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in whom such abundance of rich grace is laid up. Thus doe the Promises of God furnish both Ministers and people, with <hi>Doctrine,</hi> with <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> with <hi>Exhortation,</hi> in their kinds.</p>
            <p>Now there is a three-fold effect that they have in some of all sorts, good and bad, that live in the bosome of the Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They have a power of illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they will enlighten the minds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Hypocrites, and men indued with no more than common gifts, as well as the people of God; of such the Apostle speaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>who were once enlighted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and had tasted of the good word of God;</hi> An Hypocrite may have such a tast of Christ in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and be</p>
            <p n="2">2 So affected with it, that he despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all other things in comparison of it; so as that he cometh to resolve for
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:199237:63"/>his part never to forgoe him; and hath so much confidence in God, that he saith with <hi>Haman, Whom will the King delight to honour more than my selfe?</hi> and this illumination he taketh to be a strong and effectuall Conversion unto the Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The Promises have a worke of conviction, if any man refuse or despise them, they leave him unexcusable, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.24, 25, 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus is their blood justly upon their owne head, that refuse and despise the Promises, and they ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their condemnation another day; and to this end the Apostle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth use of a pretious Promise of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39, 40, 41. A strange ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of such a gratious Promise; a signe, there is a power in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, even unto this end.</p>
            <p>Thus we see there is a marvelous gratious use of Promises before Union with Christ; as to help Ministers and people with matter of Doctrine and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and Exhortation; as also to awaken men unto Illumination, and Affection, and Conviction, and to seal them up unto everlasting destruction, if they turn their back<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:199237:64"/> 2 As the Promises are of use before our Union with Christ, so <hi>In our union with him</hi> they are of great use; for when the Lord giveth himselfe to the soule, he doth it in a Promise; he cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soule, riding (as it were) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chariot of a Promise, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth Faith back again in the soul by the Promise, whereby we receive Jesus Christ; though before him we can have no Promise, yet in a Promise we doe receive him. This is the very first stroke of closing with Christ, he giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and we take him as he offereth himselfe, even in an absolute Promise; such a like dispensation of himselfe we read of, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25, 26. where Christ is offered in an Absolute Promise of free grace, without any Qualification mentioned, <hi>Howbeit many of them that heard the word believed, and the number of the men were about five thousand;</hi> about three thousand of them believed before, so that here are two thousand that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve upon this Absolute Promise, the Lord Christ is offered to them, and they receive him by Faith. The like we read also, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43, 44. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witnesse, that through his name,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:199237:64"/>whosoever believeth in him, shall receive remission of sins.</hi> And <hi>while</hi> Peter <hi>yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the words;</hi> so that the Holy Ghost giveth himselfe, and they receive him in an absolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; and lest it should be a matter of absolute doubt unto any, consider thus much, that whereas the Lord doch u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite himselfe to the soule, as a Father to a child, or as an Husband to a wife, it is free: For did you ever know a true reall Marriage made in a Conditionall Promise? Doth a man say to his wife, <hi>If you prove a loving and a kind wife, then I will be thine Husband?</hi> Or doth a wife say to her Husband, <hi>If you will take me and love and maintaine me, and all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that God shall blesse us with, then I will be your wife?</hi> Would not your soule rise against such a Covenant as this? Now I beseech you consider whether we shall not put an unspeakable disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon the Covenant of free grace, to conceive and expect, that if we carry our selves thus and thus, then God will be ours, and we his: But if thus and thus, then he will cast us off; Hath the Lord made such a Covenant with his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:199237:65"/>Elect? Indeed the Lord would have the <hi>Jewes</hi> to know, that though he were marryed to them, yet he would not continue that Covenant, but upon condition of obedience; when they were disobedient, the Lord gave them a bill of Divorce; but in the Covenant of Grace (spoken of, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.19, 20.) the Lord giveth himselfe, and you take him in an absolute Promise; and now the Lord dwelleth in you, and the soul yieldeth up it selfe unto God, to be wholly at his disposing, and doth not stint nor limit God upon this and this condition, nor doth the Lord so bind us to the performance of any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that if it be not found, the Covenant will be voyd, yet he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth many things of us (as an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band will doe of his wife) as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o be meek and lowly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if we faile, the Covenant is not broken; therefore believe it, it doth much dishonour the Covenant of Grace, to lay the weight of our interest in it, upon any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by which we might plead our right unto it. I confesse that the Lord doth usually give himselfe in a <hi>future Promise,</hi> which makes us conceive that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:199237:65"/>it is not so absolute a Covenant: when persons give themselves one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they give themselves absolutely, and not in a future Promise, and say, <hi>I take thee to be my wife, and I take thee to be mine Husband;</hi> but all times are alike unto God, that if the Lord say, <hi>I will marry thee to me in tender mercies, and faithfullnesse, and loving kindnesse,</hi> he doth that for the present, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to doe; and againe it breed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in the soule a Reciprocall Union, that though it know not whether the Lord hath given himselfe, yet this it findeth, namely, a patient waiting with hope, that the Lord will shew mercy at the length: as when a woman hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of marriage from her Husband, she waiteth in hope untill he give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: so there is an Union or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, when the soule doth waite upon God, but when the Lord giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seife more fully, then he speaketh more plainly, and giveth himselfe, not in a future, but in a present Promise; and now the soule seeth that the Lord hath gracious fellowship with him, for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Thus we see that promises are not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:199237:66"/>vaine things, but there are great use of them, <hi>before</hi> our Union all promises are of excellent use: <hi>in</hi> our Union the Lord giveth himselfe in an absolute promise onely, but to take Christ in a Conditionall promise, by vertue of the Condition, is incompatible to a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>After our union with Christ,</hi> they are of more abundant use. They were of use before we were in Christ, for <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and for <hi>Instruction,</hi> and for <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,</hi> but now they are of more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy in the same kind, and</p>
            <p n="1">1 They serve us for <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to teach us that there is not onely free grace in Christ, but there are gifts of grace in him, and all the treasures of the good things of God are in him, and all the blessings of the promises made unto Qualifications, are layd up in him also.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They serve for <hi>Instruction,</hi> to direct us whither to look for Qualifications, and the blessings promised unto them also, namely, to the Lord Jesus Christ, to receive the blessing through him, and the Qualification by the same hand; for they are first fulfilled in him: there is no good Condition but it is found
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:199237:66"/>in Christ, no blessing thereunto, but it is found in him also; in him therfore they are to be sought for: so that though a poor soule see himselfe wretched, and blind, and naked, yet he hath an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in whom all riches are laid up; this he is taught to know by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and directed also to goe to Jesus Christ, that enjoying him, he way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all good things in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 They are of use to stirre up unto <hi>Prayer,</hi> for now I see that all these good things are in Christ, and in him they must be enjoyed, if they he enjoyed at all; hereupon the soule is set a work (the Holy Ghost concurring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with) to consider, Is there so much grace in Christ, and in him abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Hath the Lord made so many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious promises unto such and such gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Qualifications? whether then should I goe, either for the one, or for the other, but unto Christ, that he may work in us a spirit of Faith, of Love, and of a sound mind? and whatsoever else we stand in need of? <hi>Give unto thy Servant a wise and an understanding heart,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> when the Lord bad him ask what he should give him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.9. Thus are the Servants of God stirred
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:199237:67"/>up by Conditionall promises, to seek unto the Lord for the supply of all their wants, for in him are all good things laid up, and by him are they gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto his servants.</p>
            <p n="4">4 They are of use to helpe us to <hi>Know our spirituall state, and means to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern thereof:</hi> All these qualifications to which the promises are made, are fruits of the Spirit, and will more or lesse declare unto you, your sanctified state, which is a marvelous blessing: Upon the promises made unto such conditions, the Lord stirreth up the hearts of his people, to seek for such conditions to which the promises are made, and when the Lord hath given them, he then openeth their hearts to see what he hath given them, and so to discern their sanctified estate. <hi>Now I know that thou fearest me, seeing thou hast not with-held thy Son, thine only Sonne from me;</hi> so the Lord saith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22.12. wherein he bare witnesse to his work, and this doth fill <hi>Abraham</hi> with strong Consolation, together with the Oath of God unto him: for now the Lord doth not onely know it, but cause him to know it also: so that if
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:199237:67"/>the Lord doth but breath in such fruit of the Spirit, if he doth but give pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the soule to doe such a work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the promise is made, and doe make it appear unto the soule to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed such by the revelation of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirit, then doth the Lord fill the soule with Consolation: But though the Holy Ghost himselfe doth not so sweetly and strongly breath, and clear up his own Testimony, by the comfort which he giveth unto the soule in such a promise, yet a man by the Promise may (being enlightned of God) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerne what God hath done for him; and hereby the soule may stay it selfe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.18. <hi>The expectation of the poore shall not perish for ever:</hi> When the poor soule is meekned by Gods hand, and the Lord letteth him so discern it, that now he quietly resteth upon the Lord, now the Spirit of God doth help <hi>David</hi> along to be supported with some stay; and besides the waiting of a Christian upon him, who hath made the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, doth make him yet more patient and hopefull. And this is a fourth use of Conditionall promises, to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Faith.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:199237:68"/> 5 They are of use to work all these qualifications in us, to which the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings are promised, by the <hi>exceeding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Promises, we are made partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. and this is no small work or use of these promises, that from them should spring all our gratious qualifications; for the Lord having promised such blessings in them, these promises being received and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and meditated on by us, <hi>we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them, and the glory of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus in them, are changed into the same I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from glory to glory, even as by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. This great power there is in the Promises, to help an end the work of God in the soul of a Christian: so that though they were never given to bring us to Christ, yet to this end they were given, to work all those qualifications in us, to which the blessings are promised. Yea, and they may truly be said to be given to bring us to Christ, in this sense, That though our Faith be not begotten by any promises to gratious qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons prae-existent in us; yet they may beget such qualifications of Faith, to which promises are made.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:199237:68"/> 6 They are of use to <hi>stir up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Christians to all such duties to which blessings are promised;</hi> they stir them up effectually. The Lord maketh a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18. And mark what use the Apostle maketh of it, being a conditionall Promise, Chap. 7.1. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore these Promises, &amp;c. let us, &amp;c.</hi> implying, that the having of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises stirreth up Gods people unto du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the Lord is wont to breath in them, and so to set forwards the work of cleansing of the hearts and wayes of his servants.</p>
            <p n="7">7 They are of use further, to <hi>strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Faith:</hi> for the Lord that hath made such Promises, will accomplish them for his Servants, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9, 10. <hi>Jacob</hi> there putteth the Lord in mind of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and said, <hi>O God of my father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and God of my father Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, Returne unto thy Countrey, and to thy Kindred, and I will deale well with thee;</hi> and he was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned according to the appointment of God, but what now, doth he plead the condition? mind in the next words, <hi>I am not worthy the least of all the mercy, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:199237:69"/>unto thy Servant?</hi> yet now though he pleadeth not any worth at all, yet see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord had promised such a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to him, he prayeth for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother.</hi> Thus his faith is strengthned, though he doth not plead any worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to receive mercy. So also doe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute promises strengthen faith, and the prayer of faith, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.13, 14, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> The Lord there promiseth <hi>David,</hi> that he would build him an house, and that he would not take his mercy from his Children, thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> stirreth up and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the faith of <hi>David,</hi> ver. 28, 29, <hi>&amp;c. This well ordered and sure Covenant of God was all his stay, and all his salvation though his house was not so with God,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. So when the Lord promiseth to heal the backslidings of his people, <hi>Ho.</hi> 14.5. their hearts are strengthned to come unto the Lord, and say, <hi>O Lord thy words are true, let it please thee to heal the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings of thy servants.</hi> Thus by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God, the Faith and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prayers of his servants, are both strengthned together.</p>
            <p>Now let me further say thus much, let us rightly discern what use to make
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:199237:69"/>of the principall part of the Scriptures, take heed you doe not close with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises before we have Jesus Christ in them: especially take heed you make not use of a promise to a gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, to give you your part in Christ, neither be taken aside to make account that the Lord did give you himselfe gratiously in a conditionall promise, for these are aberrations from the Covenant of grace: consider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well that the promises be, and what use the Lord would have us to make of them, it is not for a woman to take her husbands inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shee take his person; &amp; you know that all the blessings and all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are (as it were) the Inheritance of the Lord Jesus, given unto him and to no other but in his name, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is not any soule under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that can challenge his Right in Christ at the first by any promise, till Christ first be given, either in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, or in some former: if you know that you are in Christ, you may know that the promises are yours, otherwise you shall not be able to know your right in Christ by your right in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:199237:70"/>promises; and therefore doe not turne them upside downe beyond the scope and intendment of the promises of the Covenant of grace: we may take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by them to admire the goodnesse and grace of God, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31.19. Thus ought we to consider of them, and whither to looke that we might enjoy them, and the blessings in them: If you shall say we have been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and have had gratious changes wrought in us; be not deceived, such worke may reach no farther than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and you may come to turne your backs upon Jesus Christ. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore did ever the Lord give himselfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o be one with you; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Lord doth strike up the bond of Union, it is in a free promise of his grace.</p>
            <p>Trust not therefore upon every lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your soule upon conditionall promises, for so you may build upon a Covenant made upon a worke, and so you and your Covenant may faile together. But when you read how the Lord hath made such promises to such and such qualifications, then consider, that those things are indeed requisite
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:199237:70"/>to be found in you, but who is there in heaven or earth that can worke them in you, there is none but Jesus Christ, and unlesse you have him to be in you, you cannot have any of these things wrought in you. But will a poore soule say, I am not able to reach the Lord Jesus Christ, therefore all the promises doe fall heavie upon a man, and he seeth that they are too burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and too weighty for him: he doth not say, here is the qualification, and here is the blessing promised to it, and therefore I will take it to my selfe, but one that is taught of God, doth forthwith goe and pray unto God, that he will set him in the way of those blessings, and that so he will make him partaker of them, he prayeth that God will give him his Sonne, and that he will adorne him with his grace, as a bride of Jesus Christ. Thus while the soule doth looke towards Jesus Christ, and grace in him, the Lord doth secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transforme him into the image of Christ, by working such qualifications in him, and then beareth witnesse to that sanctification, which is wrought in his heart, thereby enlarging his soule
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:199237:71"/>with strong consolation in Jesus Christ; and in the same way it is that the Lord doth strengthen the faith of his people to believe, that all those things, which God hath promised, are accomplished in Jesus Christ, and the Law fullfilled in me so farre as Christ is in me, and therefore I come unto God in prayer to make good those promises unto me, in a right way, which would have been preposterously applyed before Christ was given: And this may serve for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the 5<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Question.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>6</label> Wee come now unto a sixt Question. If the Lord doe give himselfe first in the Covenant of his grace, this may then be a doubt and a question in a Christian soule, If God give himselfe before any blessing, before any promise in order of nature (though he giveth himselfe alwayes in a promise) if wee cannot claime any blessing from God at the first in any conditionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, therefore not by any condition in our selves, but as we received all things from God, so wee claime all things from him in Jesus Christ, and so doe first seeke for him, and for all things in him: If thus, to what use then
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:199237:71"/>serveth the Law of God, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth such and such conditions in us, doe we not abrogate the Law, &amp; make it of none effect, and roote it out from having any power over Christians? And truly some, under pretence of the Covenant of grace, have thought it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together bootlesse to bind Christians unto the Law of God, and to looke at it as any part of the direction of their Course. Now because this is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation usually reflected upon the Covenant of Grace, let us Consider therefore and enquire to what use ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Law of God, if God give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe first unto his people in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his grace.</p>
            <p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
               </label> Though the Lord giveth himselfe freely to the soule, and his Sonne, and all the blessings of the Covenant of grace, without respect unto any worke of the Law; yet the Law is of speciall and notable use unto all the sonnes of men, both unto them that are not yet brought home unto God by convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, and also to those that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate in Jesus Christ. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did observe that the question would arise upon the doctrine of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:199237:72"/>Covenant of grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18. <hi>For if the blessing of Abraham came upon the people of God by Jesus Christ, to what end then serveth the Law, which came</hi> 430 <hi>yeares after?</hi> It cannot disanull grace, to make the promise of God of none effect? <hi>to what end then serveth it?</hi> Some say it is of no use, others say that it is of such use that they had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the C venant of grace than it: but the Answer is, it is of especiall use both unto spirituall and carnall men.</p>
            <p>First, unto carnall men, and they are of two sorts, some belong unto the election of grace, though they be not yet called; others are not written in the Lambs booke of life, but will in the end finally perish, and the Law is yet of use unto both sorts of them.</p>
            <p>For the Elect, it is of use unto them; to aggravate their sin, and to multiply it unto them as it were, that is to say, to aggravate the apprehension of the hainousnesse of sin upon their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and to set home the burthen of sin unto their soules, thereby to drive them to feele their great need of the Lord Jesus Christ, whom otherwise they should for ever have despised.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:199237:72"/>Thus the Apostle answereth in the place aforenamed, <hi>The Law was added, because of transgressions;</hi> that they might cleerely appeare, and be aggravated thereby, that a man might plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne how he hath made himselfe lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the wrath of God, by so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold breaches of so many Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in one kinde or other: the Law giveth cleere knowledge of sinne, and so much the more doth it set on the weight of it upon the Conscience, working feare in the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. And hence it is, that the Apostle telleth us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Law was our Schoole-Master to Christ;</hi> As a Schoole-Master driveth his Scholler through feare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this or that duty, either to doe it himselfe, or (if he cannot) to get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to doe it for him; so the Law of God driveth the soule through feare unto Jesus Christ; not that it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale Christ a Saviour of free-grace, but the soule being once brought downe under sense of sin by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Law, will readily &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly hearken unto the newes of <hi>Christ a Saviour;</hi> for being once made sensible of his owne inability to redeeme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:199237:73"/>and unworthines to be redeemed from the wrath of God; now is the soule fitted to heare the voyce of the Gospell, now is the newes of Christ beautifull and glad tidings: And of this use is the Law unto the Elect of God, before they come under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the grace of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But of what use is the Law unto other men?</p>
            <p>First, the Disobedience of it is of use. Secondly, the Obedience of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Disobedience;</hi> for if men had not knowne sin, it had been some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, though they had committed sin, but when men have the knowledge of the Law, and yet commit sin willingly, now they have no cloake for their sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. compared with 32. where the Apostle speaketh of the great sin of the Gentiles, and much more of the Jewes, <hi>Who though they knew God, and the judgement of God, and that they which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit such wickednes are worthy of death, yet not onely doe the same, but have pleasure in them that doe them.</hi> When a man shall not onely doe such wickednes, but blesse himselfe in it, this aggravateth a mans condemnation, if men will not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:199237:73"/>come unto <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> that they might have life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. what saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in such a Case, see <hi>vers.</hi> 45. <hi>Moses</hi> will judge all those that please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in wickednes, and will not turne to the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus there is use of the Law unto disobedient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, their disobedience will leave them without excuse, when they sin against their consciences, &amp; against the meanes which the Lord hath administred unto them: for though the Lord never gave them such grace as did accompany sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, yet such Illumination he did give them, that they needed not to have broken his Law so many wayes with such wicked hands as they have done▪ therefore when they have been inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to performe many duties, &amp; might avoyd much sin, &amp; yet will sin against their consciences, and tread under foot those meanes of grace that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, It is then most righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous with God, that they should be condemned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of what use is the Obedience of the Law unto, such, whom Gods soule takes no pleasure in? Truly it is of sad and dreadfull use unto them, for it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:199237:74"/>to harden them in their sinnes, (though that be but an accidentall use thereof) their sinnes are thereby made out of measure sinfull, <hi>Rom</hi> 7.13. They harden their hearts marvellously.</p>

            <p>For the first of these; the Apostle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 23.1. had kept so good a Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he knew not any sin against the Law that he had lived in, but though he was unrebukeable, he did count it all losse afterward, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>Those things that before he thought had been his gaine, now he counteth them but dung that he may winne Christ:</hi> when a man attaineth unto outward confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law, he is then indeed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to justifie himselfe, and to thinke that it is indeed good for poore sinfull men to looke for salvation by Jesus Christ: but for himselfe he hopeth in his selfe-devotion, and that he is able to save himselfe; these are such as justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themselves before men, to whom our Saviour speaketh, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. And of whom he saith, that <hi>Publicans and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots shall goe into the kingdome of heaven

Thus the Law becometh a snare unto them, and that which is of singular and wholsome use unto the children of God, is made death unto them. And as their obedience to the Law is thus a snare unto them; So, secondly, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and comfort which they take in their obedience, is a greater snare than the other; The stony and thorny soile did <hi>heare the word with joy,</hi> and so those hypocrites, <hi>Isai.</hi> 58. did <hi>delight to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto God;</hi> but what followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the delight which they tooke in God, and in holy duties, it made them ready to expostulate with God, why he did not answer them according to their works: the delight which they found did so fill their hearts with As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the grace of God, that they looked at their duties, as so many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the love of God unto their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:199237:75"/>soules; and then when men come to sinde more comfort in their obedience, than in the grace of God in Jesus Christ, it maketh them ready to expostulate with God touching the worth of their owne righteousnes. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.10. <hi>Thou hast found the life of thine hand, therefore thou wast not grieved;</hi> So long as a man findeth life and comfort in his owne performances, what need can he see to be grieved for the want of <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> or at the best, if he doe grieve and finde his heart comforted in grieving, and delighting in the Course of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, he then thinketh he hath no need of being further solicitous about his spirituall estate. Thus we see that the Law of God is of marvellous use in the dayes of the Gospell; of great use unto those that belong unto God, to breake their hearts for sinne, and to drive them to <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the disobedience of the Law leaves them without excuse, that so disobey it. Againe, the obedience of it and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in that obedience doth harden the hearts of others from Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But what say you then unto men that are under a Covenant of grace,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:199237:75"/>and brought unto fellowship with Christ therein? of what use is the Law of God unto such? is it utterly anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated? or is there any more to be done about it?</p>

Our Saviour would not have us thinke, that <hi>he came to destroy the Law, or the Prophets, but to fullfill them;</hi> and to that end he doth there expound the spirituall &amp; true meaning of the Law; that whereas the Pharisees held forth the outward letter of the Law to be observed onely, as thinking that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse a man did commit the act of <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> he was not guilty of the breach of the sixt Commandment; and if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not the act of <hi>Adultery,</hi> he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed not the seventh Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and so of the rest; Our Saviour Christ expoundeth the Law more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, shewing that <hi>Anger</hi> against a mans brother is a breach of the sixt Commandment, and <hi>whosoever shall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:199237:76"/>looke on a woman to lust after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his heart,</hi> and broken the seventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. Thus <hi>Christ</hi> hath as it were revived <hi>Moses;</hi> but as the Law given by Christ is not a Covenant of works, but a Commandment of well-doing; and he having given it, we take our selves bound to be subject unto it. The Apostle also presseth the morall Law upon severall relations of men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. &amp;c. It is an honour to Christ, that his servants should be holy, as he is holy; it is for the glory of God, and he requireth it; the Apostle <hi>James</hi> pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.8. to the end of the Chapter; <hi>If you fullfill the Royall Law, according to the Scripture. (Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe) ye doe well.</hi> And againe, <hi>Whosoever shall keepe the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> Thus wee see the Apostles of Jesus Christ put it upon Christians to keepe the Law of God; and Christ himselfe beareth witnes to the Law, <hi>for God will never justifie sin to be no sin, though he will justifie the person of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as the Lord Jesus giveth the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:199237:77"/>Law, and as it were renueth it, so he doth also give his Spirit unto his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, enabling them to keep it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33 and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. Now this Law would he not write in the hearts of his people, nor give unto them his holy Spirit, enabling them to keepe it, were it not his will in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that the Law should be the Rule of holines and righteousnes unto his people; hence it is that the children of God, though they be not under the Covenant of the Law, yet take themselves to be bound to the obedience of it, for if <hi>Christ</hi> have given the Law as well as <hi>Moses,</hi> and if he have ratified it by giving them his Spirit to teach and strengthen them to keepe it, though not perfectly, yet sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, then they take themselves bound to obey the Law, though they be under the Covenant of grace; for <hi>doe we make voyd the Law through faith? God forbid; yea, we establish the Law;</hi> for what need have Christians of free justification by Christ, if they were not bound unto the obedience of the Law by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Law? therefore the free justification of men under a free Covenant of grace doth establish the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:199237:77"/>obedience of the Law; otherwise what need they run to Christ to save them from the Curse of the Law? Why doe we still run to Christ for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Justification, but that we find our selves ungodly Creatures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the righteous and holy Law of God? Therefore if God have given men the Law, &amp; his Holy Spirit to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them in the obedience of it, and his grace to save them from the curse of it, then Christians are to know, that they are bound to keep the Law, they lye under the authority of it, and dare not pluck their necks from under that yoke.</p>
            <p>Now there are divers effects spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the subjection of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Commandement of the Law.</p>
            <p n="1">1 As they take themselves bound to the obedience of it, so they believe and many times feele the fatherly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God, when they transgresse it; now the transgression of the Law could not bring them under the displeasure of God, unlesse they were bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Commandement of the Law: This displeasure <hi>David</hi> was sensible of,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:199237:78"/>
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 38.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he makes many complaints, which doe all of them spring from the conscience of the disobedience of the Law, which God hath framed in the hearts of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whereby they reflect upon their sin as the ground of all the distempers, which lye upon their bodies or minds. This is the first effect of the subjection of Gods people to his Law, they lye under the faith and sense of the danger of the disobedience of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They are under the faith and sense also of Gods gratious acceptance of their wayes, when they are sutable to the blessed directions of his word; not that they can raise there-from their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified estate, but by the same Spirit of God, whereby they are helped to obey the Commandements of God, they doe see the Lords gratious approbation of them in their poore and weake endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; for <hi>the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous,</hi> that is, acknowledgeth and approveth it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.6. When the Lord by his Spirit boweth the hearts of his people unto obedience, then he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and accepteth their obedience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. Thus the Lord beareth witness
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:199237:78"/>unto his Servants, that he doth accept their works; so that they sensibly know and believe, that the Lord doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their poorest and weakest endeavours, unto which they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth by his Spirit, in the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his word: this the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> confirmeth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.20. <hi>to</hi> 26. where he speaketh of his righteous dealing with <hi>Saul,</hi> and whereas his enemies laid it to his charge that he was an enemy unto <hi>Saul,</hi> the Lord beareth him witnes, that he had walked toward <hi>Saul</hi> with a good conscience; now the Lord having led him an end to deale justly, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously, and purely with <hi>Saul,</hi> having kept him from all the malice and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Saul,</hi> and maintained his cause against him, and delivered him out of his hands, whom the Lord had now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, herein the Prophet seeth the Lord accepting him, when in the name of his Son, by the power of his Spirit, he is helped to attend unto the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God. This is comfortable unto a Christian spirit, when the Lord beareth witnesse unto his soule, that he hath an eye to all the Commandments of God. And all this argueth, that the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:199237:79"/>servants of God, being in a state of grace in Jesus Christ, have looked at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as bound by the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law, and as being under the Law to Christ, who hath given the Law and power unto his servants sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to keep it, both by writing in their hearts a Law of obedience, and by putting his Holy Spirit within them; for if the people of God were not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their bounden duty to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Law of God, they would neither have faith nor sence of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly displeasure, when they negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently breake these Lawes; neither would they be sensible of Gods accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their conformity thereunto. But we know what the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our rejoycing it this, the Testimony of our Conscience,</hi> &amp;c. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord doth often beare witnesse unto the integrity of his Servants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the oppositions of men. So he did to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> and to sundry of the Servants of God, though they are not wont to build their safe estate thereupon: Yet this kind of Gods acceptance of their wayes and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they doe discern, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:199237:79"/>best obedience, which they doe perform, they see the need they have to goe unto God for justifying grace, because if they have failed in any one circumstance, their best righteousnesse is polluted, therefore they have need of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to cover the failings of their most strict performances; this <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of, when he had been very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in reforming the abuses of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,</hi> and of many other Ordinances of God; and though the Lord had help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to undertake the Reformation with much dexterity and successe, yet for all this he runneth unto Christ for acceptance and pardon, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.22. And what would he have done if he had been conscious of some grosse sin? He would then much more have run to the Lord Jesus. Thus the Law is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by faith, for there is no justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed person but is very apprehensive of his sins, and so his continuall need of <hi>Christ, whose blood cleanseth us from all sins,</hi> John 1.7. and <hi>who is faithfull and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousnesse,</hi> vers. 9 <hi>who is an Advocate (if any man sin) and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our sins,</hi> Chap. 2.1, 2. And
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:199237:80"/>what doe all these things argue, but that a Christian, being under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the grace of God, doth submit himselfe unto this yoke of God. Thus far then a Christian is under the Law to Christ, so far as the Law is under Christ; he is under the Command of Christ, and under his power and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, if he negligently sin against the Law, and unto Christ he runneth for pardon and cleansing, and unto him he cometh for acceptance of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; so that he hath no use of the Law but unto Christ, and in and under him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how is a Christian not under the Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So far forth as the Law is not under Christ, I meane so far as it is <hi>without Christ,</hi> freely justifying us by his grace, so far a Christian is freed from under the Law. In one word, a Christian man, under a Covenant of grace, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Covenant of works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>You are not under the Law, but under grace.</hi> He meaneth, not under the Covenant of the Law, nor under the power and authority of the Law, as of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.1, 2, 3, 4. The husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:199237:80"/>jurisdiction of the Law is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. <hi>The Law is not made for a righteous man,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.9. That is, not the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Law; for else we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Commandments of the Law to Christ: But the Jewish Teachers taught more, to wit, the Covenant of the Law unto salvation: Not but that <hi>the Law is good if a man use it lawfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how shall a man use it lawfully?</hi> for it is not given unto <hi>a righteous man,</hi> but he reckoneth up the breaches of every Commandement, and unto them it is given; <hi>To the lawlesse and disobedient, to the ungodly and sinners, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.9. The Covenant of the Law is given to such (and to none but such) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their sinnes against the Law, to humble them to the death, and to drive them out of themselves, and all confidence in themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how doth it appear that the Covenant of the Law is not given to the Children of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it is manifest, because a Christian man neither looketh for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and salvation from his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, nor feareth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, though he faile in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:199237:81"/>and this is a fruit of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from under the Covenant of the Law; for if a man should look for life by his obedience to the Law, and fear condemnation by the breach of it, this would bring a man under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Law; for the sanction of the Covenant of the Law is <hi>Life</hi> to them that obey, and to them that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey <hi>death and the curse;</hi> but a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an looketh not for life by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that is plain, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. Therefore no hope of salvation from our obedience to the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But me thinks</hi> (you will say) <hi>a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may feare his condemnation, because of his disobedience to the Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly this is a great snare, and this doctrine will be scandalous to many a poor soule, but without cause; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if God give a man to be under the Covenant of grace, and not to see it, then he may fear; but if a man know himselfe to be under the Covenant of grace, then he doth not feare condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from his disobedience; nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this purpose is the confidence of <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 49.5. where the Prophet calleth upon all people in the world
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:199237:81"/>to take notice of it, both <hi>men of high and low degree: Wherefore should I feare in the dayes of evill, when the iniquities of my heeles shall compasse me about?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Truly if there be any fear in the world, one would think this should procure it? what should a man fear, if not this: <hi>David</hi> yet professeth it, and would have all men to know it, that there is no cause therein why a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man should fear; <hi>wherefore should I fear?</hi> &amp;c. Though it should follow you to the Stocks, or to Prison, yet there is no cause why it should make you fear. <hi>Men that trust themselves in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their riches, none of them can by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransome for him, that he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.</hi> Had <hi>David</hi> had nothing but the wealth of his Kingdome, he might have feared well enough, but here's his confidence, <hi>vers.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But will not this make a Christian wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton against God, and cause him to abuse his liberty to hardnesse of heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No, no, this is the kindly melting of a godly heart, to consider a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:199237:82"/>love, drawing him from the power of the grave, and that he should by his sins pierce the Lord Jesus Christ, this melteth him more than all his other sins, especially considering the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace of God, <hi>which where sin hath abounded, aboundeth much more.</hi> Thus when a man doth not look for life by his owne righteousnesse, but knoweth the Redemption of soules to be more pretious than so, this sheweth a man not to be under a Covenant of works, and then his very <hi>iniquity</hi> shall not make him afraid, there is such a state in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and let all men know it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But will not all men think the worse of Christian profession?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No, <hi>David</hi> will have all men know it, that they may see the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all worldly confidences, and the confidence of Christians; all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of worldly men will leave them to be like the Beasts that perish, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not redeem their soules, that the Lord onely might be exalted in his Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="2">2 As a Christian looketh not for salvation by his obedience to the Law, nor feareth condemnation by his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:199237:82"/>So neither doth he seek for any blessing from his obedience, nor fear any curse from his disobedience.

He looketh not for his blessednesse from his works, though he should perform all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to which the Promises are made, yet he expecteth all his blessing from free Justification and union with the Lord Jesus Christ: <hi>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imput<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

In a Covenant of works it is with a man as it was with <hi>Leah (Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> wife (who expected love and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship from her Husband, because of her fruitfulnes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.32, 34. but thus doth not a man under a Covenant of grace, for when he hath done all he can, he is ready to say, <hi>I am an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table servant,</hi> Luke 17.10. and doth not chalenge God for any of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, he seeth he deserveth not his daily bread, and so looks for no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from his good works; though the Lord will gratiously acknowledge his servants in what they doe according to his will, yet they are not wont to plead any such thing, which is very observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the practice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he doth not presse the <hi>performance of Gods Commandement</hi> to

               </gap> have been very great. Sometimes the people of God have not onely rejected the servants of God, but the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7. But when <hi>Samuel</hi> had pressed hard upon them for their sin, Cha. 12. and they were truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, then <hi>Samuel</hi> said unto them (<hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21, 22.) <hi>Fear not,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore feare you not, he will not cast you off: So that (mind you) a poor Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doth not fear divorce from his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, for if we should look for blessings from the one, or cursings from the other, we walk as not under Christ, but under the Law: But he that is freed from the Covenant of works, is freed also from expecting salvation, or fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damnation for what he doth: He knoweth the Lord will hide his face from him, if he doe evill, but he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord will not cast him off for ever, yet he dares not commit sin, but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:199237:84"/>being under grace, he is the more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted if he shall at any time displease God, and procure chastisement to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and by this means the Lord doth mortifie his distempers; on the other side, if he doe well, he will not say now my Husband will cleave unto me, and dwell with me: No, no, we are freed from the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. But we were not so, if we look for conjugall love from God for our obedience to the law; it is true, if a man be marryed to the Law, his obedience unto it will suppply comfort unto him, but if we be dead unto the Law, we have no life in it, nor by it, but onely in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> from whom we expect our comfort▪ indeed we are troubled that we should sin against the grace of God, otherwise we look not at our obedience or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to make us accepted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And finally, the soule doth not claim his right unto any Conditionall Promise by his performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, nor doth he deny himse fe the blessing that the Promise may reach forth unto him, though he be wanting in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to this or that Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:199237:84"/>Pregnant for this purpose is the example of <hi>Jacob</hi> (which we mentioned before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9, 10. who though he had a plain and a full Promise of God to doe him good, if he would returne unto his Countrey, and to his kindred, yet when he did returne according to the word of God, he claimed not his interest in that Promise, for that he had done as God commanded him, but <hi>I am lesse than the least of thy mercies,</hi> and yet he cometh unto the Lord for the performance of his Promises: but upon this ground, onely for the sake of mercy and truth. <hi>Deliver me I pray thee, for thou saidst, I will surely doe thee good,</hi> vers. 11, 12. So that (mind you) though the soul can make use of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall Promise, and come to God for the blessing of it, yet not expecting it in the least manner by vertue of his obedience; and truly this is the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of a Christian soule, whereas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man, if he have kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and performed the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he then looketh for acceptance from God; as if the Lord make this Promise, that <hi>He that confesseth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saketh his sin, shall find mercy:</hi> This man
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:199237:85"/>confesseth his sin unto God, and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, and therefore he looketh for mercy: But this is not the manner of Gods people, and yet if they look for any mercy, it is in the way of God, but not for their owne goodnes, their hope is in the faithfulnesse and free-grace of God; they may make mention to the praise of God, how he hath guided them, and carryed them an end in his owne wayes, yet they chalenge nothing for any thing that they have done, but put the Lord in mind of his free Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus we see what need there is that the holy Ghost should dwell in us, to keepe all the gifts of his grace in us, to Act them according to his will, and to discover to us what gratious gifts the Lord hath wrought in us, and what duties he hath helped us to doe, that we may be able to give Account of them, by the holy Ghost that dwelleth in us, and beareth witness with us. We see there is a necessity both of the gifts of grace, that we may be fit Temples for the holy Ghost to dwell in, and fit instruments for him to work by; there is need also the holy Ghost should dwell in us, for the causes we have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto; And I might adde this, to <hi>comfort us</hi> in all the changes that may come upon us; it is a strong Scripture which we read in <hi>John</hi> 15.26. <hi>When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testifie of me</hi> (our Divines have no place of more cleere evidence to prove the procession of the Spirit from
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:199237:93"/>the Father) And the same Spirit testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to us, both what mighty redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he hath wrought for us, and what grace he hath wrought in us; this the holy Ghost shall testifie, even he that proceedeth from the Father; and this is the comfort of Gods people. Thus wee see both these poynts opened to us.</p>

               </label> If the Lord Jesus Christ by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit giveth us these gifts, it is our part then first to see that we doe not rest in any Sanctification which doth not spring from Christ, conveyed unto us by his Spirit conveying us to him, the Spirit knitteth us unto Christ, &amp; Christ unto us; he worketh Faith in us to receive whatsoever the Lord giveth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and by the same Faith worketh all our holinesse for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Christ is made unto us,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore we
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:199237:93"/>are to see him the principall author of all these things in us, and for us; this is the principall comfort of all gifts (Christ given in them) and the glory of all our safety; and so far as any of these lyeth in our Sanctification, we ought to see that it be Sanctification in Jesus Christ; and then it is so, when the Lord giveth us to look unto the Lord Jesus in it, and to it in him; and as we look for our holinesse to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> so we look for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall supply of it from him; and this it is to make Christ our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when as whatsoever gift the Lord giveth us, we goe not forth in the strength of it, but in the strength of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. There may be a change in the soule, which may spring from a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage, and may captivate our consciences unto the Law, that may restraine us from sin, and constraine us unto duty: but such holinesse spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not alwayes from our union with Christ, for there may be a conscience of duty without sense of our need of Christ; as it was with the <hi>Israelites</hi> at <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> Deut. 5.27, 28, 29. <hi>Goe thou neer</hi> (say they to <hi>Moses</hi>) <hi>and hear
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:199237:94"/>all that the Lord our God shall say, and speak thou unto us, all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee, and we will heare it, and doe it. They have well said, all that they have spoken, saith the Lord. O that there were an heart in them, that they would fear me,</hi> &amp;c. This I say therefore is the first thing to be attend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d unto, as ever ye would make a right use of your holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, see that it be such as floweth from Jesus Christ, and that there be not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an heart awed with the Law, but waiting upon Christ to be all in all in us and to us, so shall we neither neglect the gifts of God in us, nor Christ and his Spirit, but shall give due honour unto all of them together.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This may also Teach all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, not to trust upon the gifts of their holinesse, though they doe spring from the Holy Ghost himselfe, though they be such as are unchangeable, though they spring from Jesus Christ, and knit our soules in union with him; yet trust not in the gifts themselves; the Lord layeth it down as the Apostacy of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> Ezek. 16.14, 15. Trust not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any of these, but let all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence be in Jesus Christ, not in any
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:199237:94"/>of the gifts of his Spirit whatsoever. For a little further opening of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Trust not in any gifts that you have received for the performance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duty; for it is not the strongest Christian that is able to put forth a good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. but our suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is of God, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> cannot onely not doe any great matter by his owne strength and grace, but nothing at all without Jesus Christ; and therefore he giveth us to understand, that it is God that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us both to will and to do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. If therefore we have any new work to doe, look to the Lord Jesus Christ afresh by Faith, that he may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an end all our works in us and for us; otherwise it is not any strength or grace in us, that can produce any good work, word, or thought; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (mind you) the Apostle maketh it a principle of Christian Religion, that the just man <hi>liveth by faith,</hi> and he often mentioneth it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>The life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God;</hi> where he putteth it into his owne experience: Why, did not he live by love, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:199237:95"/>and zeale? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet, truly they were lively in him, if ever in any man, besides our blessed Saviour: and yet notwithstanding he never attributeth life to any of these gifts of his, but if he speak of life, he maketh this his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall life, <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God: and I am able to doe all things through Christ which strengtheneth me,</hi> Phi. 4.13. This is the true savour of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian spirit, that when gifts are at the highest, the heart is then at the lowest, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9, 10. the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> there acknowledgeth himselfe to be as one born out of due time; for (saith he) <hi>I am lesse than the least of the Apostles, not meet to be called an Apostle, because I perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Church of God; yea▪ but by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace, which was bestowed on me, was not in vaine, but I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God in me.</hi> This is truly spirituall sanctification, that when the soule is full of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, yet he is like a man in great penury, as having nothing of himselfe, this is a marvelous spirituall poverty, and you shall ever find (and I desire the Lord
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:199237:95"/>would open the hearts of his people to know what I speak) that if Christians have fallen, their greatest falls have been in their most eminent and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary gifts. If you shall mark the sins of all the servants of God, they have been chiefly found in the very exercise of their best gifts; let us take a little tast of them, that we may learn to use our gifts in the strength of Jesus Christ. <hi>Abraham</hi> a man full of Faith, none went beyond him in the old nor new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet if you read of any failing in him, it is in regard of the acting of Faith: what made him afraid not once but the 2<seg rend="sup">d</seg> time, that his wife would be taken from him by <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> Gen. 12. by <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Chap. 20. had not the Lord promised to blesse him whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2. He had so much of the knowledge and grace of God shining in him, that <hi>Sarah</hi> needed not to have dissembled, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> (a poor Heathen) could say as much, Chap. 20.16. <hi>Behold thy Husband is to thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved:</hi> As if he should say, thou need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est no shifts and lyes for thy protection,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:199237:96"/>and to be a vayle unto thee. This a poor Heathen can discern, that a man that hath God with him, needeth no other shifts nor covering to defend and shelter him. Thus we see that these great failings of <hi>Abraham</hi> were proper acts of unbeliefe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses</hi> a meek man, none like him for meeknesse on the face of the earth, there is but one sin storied of him after he came to the Government of that state, and this was his failing, <hi>Heare now you Rebells, must we fetch you water out of this rock?</hi> so he lift up his hand, &amp; with his rod he smote the rock twice, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.10, 11. They provoked <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> as meek as he was; sometimes when <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> dealt as peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, he was not moved from the meeknesse of his spirit: But now he falleth into passion, and this was the very sin for which the Lord excluded him out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Numb. 27.12, 13, 14. it was the breach of this royall grace, Chap. 20.12. <hi>Because ye believed me not, to sanctifie me in the eyes of the Children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this Congregation into the Land which I have given them.</hi> Which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:199237:96"/>words shew us the reason of his failing in the grace wherein he so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, <hi>Because yee believed me not.</hi> The Lord will h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ve him know, that he must live by his Faith in his <hi>meeknesse;</hi> if any man think himselfe to be a meek man, and nothing shall over-wrastle him there, if you believe not in God, but in your meeknesse, your confidence will soon faile you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter,</hi> a man full of courage, and you read of two of his principall failings, and both in point of courage; he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the high Priests hall at the voyce of a damsell; and in the porch at the speech of another maid, and the third time, at the voyce of one that stood by. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.69. &amp;c. Whereas afterwards, when he lived by faith, be became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted before the whole Councell, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.13. Another failing of his in point of courage we read of <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>He feared those of the Circumcision;</hi> whereas before he did eat with the Gentiles &amp;c. Thus the Apostle <hi>Peters</hi> eminent gifts, did not bring forth their fruits. Know therefore that the best of all your gifts, <hi>faith, courage, meeknes, wisdome, love to your brethren,</hi> will faile,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:199237:97"/>if you trust in them, and you will be most apt to faile there wherein you do most excell.</p>
            <p>If a man be wise, he shall faile in that point, and it may be in nothing so much as in that, even in those things wherein he thinketh he walketh most wisely; and such an one will find most tryalls in point of his wisedome, and the like will be found in all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all to this end, to teach the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of God to know that no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by his wisdome, nor by any thing in himselfe, but by Faith in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> whom God hath given unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and who is onely able to give new supplyes of his spirit unto his servants, to act every gift which he hath given them.</p>
            <p>I might have mentioned the example of <hi>Sarah,</hi> a meek and a quiet godly spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited woman, subject and obedient to her Husband, and called him <hi>Lord, whose daughters you are while you doe well,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.6. and yet you know, one of her greatest failings was in point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to her Husband, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.5. <hi>When she saw that she was despised, she said to her Husband, Thou dost me wrong,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:199237:97"/>Where is the reverence of <hi>Sarah</hi> now? Will you have the daughters of <hi>Sarah</hi> to imitate her herein? What had her Husband done? There was no fault in him in this matter, she had no reason to tax him upon this point, it was her owne Counsel, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. that he should goe in to her maid; <hi>that I may have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by her;</hi> therefore there was no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of any just complaint on her part, yet see this meek spirited woman fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the point of her meeknesse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and did expresse no greater failing all her life long, that we read of; she was weak in Faith once, but there was great reason for that, her womb was dead, and her <hi>Lord</hi> (as she called him) was old also: Nor doth the Angel so much blame her about it, but that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein she most failed, was in that grace wherein she most abounded. And though every grace of the Spirit be of great force when the Lord doth act and move it, yet let a man goe forth in the strength of his greatest gifts, and if ever his heart faile him, it will be in them. Thinke not when you have done all you can, that you are worthy of any thing, but say that you are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:199237:98"/>servants: For though sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be the way wherein the Lord will poure out all his blessings upon his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, yet he doth require them to boast in none of their excellencies, but look at them all, as freely given them of God; and consider, that the right unto all, springeth from fellowship with <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that so not onely the gift i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> selfe is grace, but the blessing that followeth upon the gift is grace also; and suppose that we have attained all that we pray for, shall we then exalt our owne gifts? No, but let us say with <hi>Jacob, I am lesse than the least of all the mercies and truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doe not trust, as not upon gifts, nor upon duties performed by those gifts, to reach the blessing; so look not for your <hi>Justification</hi> from thence at all; for the Apostle is plaine, that he looked not for any thing for his righteousness before his conversion; and after his conversion, he <hi>counteth it all as drosse and dung, that he might win Christ,</hi> Phil. 3.6, 7, 8. And, for our <hi>faith,</hi> they are not to be trusted upon as grounds of our Faith; for all the gifts of our sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:199237:98"/>are fruits of our Faith; and therefore our Faith is said <hi>to worke by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. and so it doth by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts of the Spirit, and if they be fruits of Faith, then Faith is not built upon them.</p>
            <p>And thus much of the second Use which Christians are to make of their Sanctification.</p>
            <p n="3">3 There is in the next place a point of <hi>Witnesse,</hi> which this Sanctification doth yield, and the Spirit of God with it; the <hi>water</hi> beareth witnesse to the <hi>blood,</hi> and the <hi>blood</hi> to the <hi>water,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> unto both, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.6, 7, 8. A mans owne Spirit beareth witnesse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. And therefore as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God unto our Faith, we may lawfully hear what it speaketh: But this is the life of a true Evidence, that all these gifts of God doe not bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse any further then a man seeth the Lord Jesus working them in him, and for him; for it is Faith that maketh all the graces of the Gospel active; and it is a condition so requisite, that unlesse our works be of Faith, and flow from it, they are not acceptable before God; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Therefore unlesse Faith car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:199237:99"/>an end our works, they are not works of holinesse, such as should bear witnesse to the soule; therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth stir up the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto this mainly, <hi>Examine your selves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are in the faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. And if he doe exhort them to Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it is in point of Faith, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Reverend <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> (who hath written a Sermon upon that Text) saith well, <hi>That unlesse men find faith in their holinesse, none of all their san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification will become a sound witnesse of the grace of God unto them;</hi> but if Faith be found, then you shall see Jesus Christ accepting you, and breathing in you, except ye be reprobates.</p>
            <p>There is a marvelous gratious wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that Sanctification giveth unto him that liveth by Faith in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> if it be in Christ, and work from him, and for him. This onely is that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which the <hi>Lord</hi> commendeth unto his servants to seek after it.</p>
            <p n="4">4 A fourth Use of our sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that the Spirit of God helpeth us by it in point of <hi>Rejoycing;</hi> and therefore it is that you shall see the Servants of God rejoycing in their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:199237:99"/>so doth the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. — <hi>This is our rejoycing, the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our conscience,</hi> &amp;c. He rejoyceth at what the Lord doth by him, and with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. But what is it that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Apostle rejoyce before God? When he rejoyceth in his work before the Lord, you shall ever find him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing at the Lords acting these gifts in him, and blessing him in his work. Let us look upon two or three Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for this end, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12, 13. So that (mind you) as he seeth God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him these gifts, and enabling him unto the work, so he blesseth God in that behalfe. You shall find him also blessing God that had prospered this worke of the Ministry wheresoever he came, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. The Lord working in him and for him, maketh him to triumph and to over-wrastle all the difficulties that he meeteth withall. The Lord had given him gifts, &amp; taught him to exercise those gifts, and doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him, and therefore he expresseth himselfe in a marvelous strong speech, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>I am in nothing ashamed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for to me to live is Christ, and to dye is gaine. To me to live is Christ;</hi> as if he had
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:199237:100"/>said, I have no life but from Christ, I put forth no act of life but for Christ; this is the sum of all his coversation; and if Christ be his life, then death will be his advantage, and Christ will be magnified in either.</p>
            <p>Thus we see how the Saints of God have made use of their Sanctification; they are carefull to see that it flow from Christ, and yet when they have it they dare not trust in their best gifts for the least duty, neither doe they look for their Faith from their best gifts, but they expect their best gifts to flow from their Faith: They make use of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of their holinesse when they see Christ in it, and Faith in it, and the Spirit of God carrying them along in the ways and duties thereof. Thus they see their holinesse, and take comfort in it, &amp; from the witnesse of it, as that by which the Lord dispenseth comfort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people, when they receive it from the hands of Christ, &amp; by Faith in him, by which they are taught of God to carry an end their whole conversation in his name.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Furthermore, as we receive it from Christ, and trust not in it, but in Christ,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:199237:100"/>and receive the witnesse of it in Christ, and in the Holy Spirit of Christ; and as we receive joy and comfort also which the Lord doth minister to us in a Sanctified course by his Holy Spirit, so we grow up and perfect our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which we have received in his name.</p>
            <p>There is growth in grace, this San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is not bedrid, Christians are not as weak now, as they were seven years agoe, nor doe they stand at a stay, but goe forward in Christianity; and hereupon the Apostle exhorteth the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians,</hi> Chap. 4.16. <hi>To speak the truth in love, that they may grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ:</hi> Implying, that men that enter into the wayes of holinesse, ought to grow on unto perfection in the fear of God, <hi>Job</hi> 17.9. And many sweet meanes the Lord hath appointed for this end; the communion of Gods people tendeth hereto, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. <hi>He that walketh with the wise, shall learn wisedome:</hi> All the Ordinances of God are appointed for this end also, to beget and encrease Faith and holinesse; therefore a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in the use of all these Ordinances,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:199237:101"/>doth not stand at a stay, but is still thriving and growing, and that not in his owne strength, but in the strength of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> seeking for his accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and help in every duty he goeth about; and this is that the Apostle doth exhort the <hi>Colossians</hi> unto, Chap. 2.6, 7. This ought Christians mainly to attend unto, that as you see the branch, the more juice it sucketh, the more fruitfull it is; so also it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the people of God to know, that the more need we stand in to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the more need we have to derive a continuall fresh supply from the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> that by his Spirit renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace in us, we may be enlarged, and carried an end in the wayes of God; whereas otherwise, the hearts of Christians would soon faile to goe on in those things wherein they desire to be growing up unto perfection.</p>
            <p>What is the reason that so many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God are not so lively in their profession as they were wont to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares agoe? Truly wee attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ordinances, but it is onely upon the outward act of them, and not upon <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in them; this is many times
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:199237:101"/>wanting in the hearts of Gods people; but truly if this be our constant frame, and wee doe not recover our selves, then is not our sanctification such as floweth from fellowship with <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> for you shall finde this to be true, that there is no gift of Christ, nor no sanctification accompanying salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it doth knit us neerer and neerer unto Christ; and the more wee are filled with true spirituall gifts, the more empty wee are of our owne strength, and selfe-conceits; and so wee ought to be, otherwise we shall constantly finde this, that if the Lord doe not preserve this empty frame in us, the more full we are of any gift, the more full shall we be of our owne strength, and consequently the lesse need shall we feele of Christ; and if this be our constant frame, it will be a sad argument that our best sanctification will not endure but fall away, unlesse we be knit unto Christ by the Spirit of his grace; for by all true sanctification we are the more knit unto him, so that if any man would know whether the superscription of Christ and his Image be stamped upon his sanctification, this
<pb facs="tcp:199237:102"/>you shall ever finde to be the stampe of the grace of Christ, that the more you receive from him, the more you stand in need of him; in so much that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the gifts of the Spirit, there is not the ablest Minister of the New Testament, but (if his gifts flow from the Spirit of Christ, and knit you unto Christ) you will finde as great need to cleave unto Christ, as ever you did the first day when you came trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling into the Pulpit. If therefore wee feele our selves full, so that the more we have received, the more sufficient we are, and goe not about the duties we have in hand in feare &amp; trembling, but in selfe-confidence, if this be our usuall and constant practise, it is but counterfeit Christianity; I doe not say that the gifts are counterfeit, for they are from the Spirit of God, and men may by them be very serviceable to Church and Common-weale, but this is certaine, that the stronger and the more your gifts are, if you sit loose from Christ, the emptier your hearts are of him. But you will say, may not a Christian be full of himselfe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the strength of his owne
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:199237:102"/>gifts? Yes, God forbid I should deny that, for the best Christians have gone astray in the exercise of their best gifts; and hereupon <hi>Abraham</hi> hath been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in faith, <hi>Moses</hi> in meeknes, <hi>Peter</hi> in courage, and <hi>Sarah</hi> in her modesty, they have been so apt to trust upon those graces of God, wherein they have most abounded, that they have principally failed therein: but this you shall finde, that (if they have been overtaken once or twice) as the burnt childe dreads the fire, so they grow to be more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of their need of Christ, more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of departing from him, more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to cleave unto him, that they might grow up in his Name unto all well pleasing in his sight. If therefore there be a sanctification that standeth at a stay in any man, it is a great suspition whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gifts thereof flow from fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with <hi>Christ,</hi> or no; if gifts be truly spirituall, a man shall usually grow up in them, <hi>Habenti dabitur.</hi> Imploy them, and multiply them; but if you imploy the gifts you have received, in your owne strength, and you are now full of your owne sanctification, truly this is but frothy work, and doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:199237:103"/>true nor lively nourishment and comfort: but the comfort and life is to him that in his most spirituall gifts &amp; best performances, is empty of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and onely full of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to live or dye is his advantage.</p>
            <p>This is the Use which I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you touching your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian sanctification. Thus we see sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things have been cleered from this doctrine concerning the Covenant of grace. There remaineth another thing to be resolved and cleered from the doctrine; for if God in the Covenant of his grace doe give himselfe to be <hi>a God</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his seede, It is then to be enquired, How God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth himselfe, and how the Son, and how the holy Ghost giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; for these are the fundamentalls of the Covenant of grace, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be opened for cleering the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of it.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:199237:105"/>what you have often heard, and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose long agoe received; As that the Lord calleth his people out of their sinnes by the light of the Law, and by the Spirit of <hi>bondage;</hi> he setteth home the Law effectually unto the soule, and thereby draweth us from sin and from the world in some measure, that we have now no minde to those things which before we were full of delight in, whether they be sinnes against the Law, or sinnes against the Gospell: it is the Lords usuall dealing by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to set home sinnes against both, in so much that thereby we come to be afflicted with some kinde of trembling and feare and torment about our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall estate. And thus it was with <hi>Saul</hi> (who afterwards was <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>Acts</hi> 9.3, 4, 5, 6. when Christ called unto him out of heaven, and challenged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him of sinne, he all trembling and astonished said, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> So it was with the <hi>Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> Acts 16.29. After the Lord had shaken his heart with an earth-quake (which is a sanction of the Law, and a ratification of it, as all Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are) he called for a light, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:199237:106"/>sprang in, <hi>and came trembling to Paul and Silas.</hi> Thus the Lord draweth men out of themselves, and their sinfull wayes by a spirit of bondage, whereby they are convinced of sinne, and desert of Gods wrath, are greatly and deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with feare: concerning which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>God hath not given us the Spirit of feare</hi> (or bondage) <hi>but of power, of love, and of a sound mind,</hi> &amp;c. Such feare also the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>John</hi> speaketh of, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. when he saith, <hi>Perfect love casteth out feare, for feare hath torment;</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the sense of a mans estate; whereby he is forced to cry out many times, and to say, woe worth my soule, that ever I was borne, for the Lord causeth me to possesse all my sinnes, and presseth me downe to the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most hell. This is one worke of the Spirit of bondage, by which the Lord draweth the soule out of it selfe and sinnes, though of it selfe the spirit of feare goeth no further than to shake a mans carnall confidence; which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with Anguish and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.10.</p>
            <pb n="177" facs="tcp:199237:106"/>
            <p> Besides this Spirit of Bondage, the Lord hath another work, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Spirit of <hi>Burning,</hi> Mal. 4.1. <hi>The day cometh,</hi> &amp;c. This is a Spirit of <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> let us speak unto it a little; the Prophet saith, <hi>It shall leave them neither root nor branch.</hi> There are two things in the root.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first is the <hi>Roote of Abrahams Covenant,</hi> which this people much tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted upon; and that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it of which <hi>John Baptist</hi> speaketh, <hi>Now the axe is layd to the roote of the Tree,</hi> &amp;c. and this he spake (<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9) after he had said, <hi>Thinke not to say within your your selves, Wee have Abraham to our father,</hi> vers. 8. So that all the confidence that they had in <hi>Abrahams Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> and <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and such things, is burnt up, and so they have no roote left them to stand upon. And this is one thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the <hi>Roote.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, there is something more in it, for with this Spirit of <hi>burning,</hi> the Lord by the power of this Spirit doth cut us off from any power of our owne naturall gifts, and parts, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts also, whereby we thought to lay hold on Jesus Christ; and we are
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:199237:107"/>cut off hereby from all the confidences that we have in our owne sufficiency; when once the Lord intendeth to bring a soule unto himselfe; for there is an usuall presidence that we have in our owne state, though the Lord have cut us off from hope in the righteousnesse of our parents, and from boasting of his Ordinances, yet we thinke there is some power still left us, and therefore we hope and will seeke in our owne strength, that the Lord may reveale himselfe to us in mercy and peace; but when the Lord cometh neerer unto us, he will shew us how unable we are to take up the least good resolution, we shall finde our selves, like bruised reeds unable to hold up our heads; for Christ came to seeke and to save that which was <hi>lost,</hi> so that Christ will not declare himselfe to seeke us untill we be lost, and therefore he saith, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.24. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himselfe, and follow me;</hi> And according hereunto it is that those converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. doe cry out when they were pricked in their heart, and said unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the rest of the Apostles, <hi>Men and brethren, what shall wee doe?</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:199237:107"/>Hence it is also that the poore soule<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that came unto Christ, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.20. were like bruised reeds that could not hold up their heads, for the Lord in this case bruiseth them, &amp; layeth them low, that they see no more hope of mercy, nor likelihood that God should shew them any hope. Thus doth the Lord <hi>burne</hi> up the <hi>Root of Abrahams Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> wherein men trust, and the <hi>Roote of all our selfe-sufficiency,</hi> that now wee find our selves dryed up &amp; our strength consumed, that now we are not able to thinke as of our selves a good thought.</p>
            <p>And againe the Lord by this spirit of burning doth burne up all our <hi>branches</hi> also, how faire and greene soever they have been; All our fastings, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations, and almsdeeds, and prayers, such things as the Pharisees much boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. &amp;c. but these things are all burnt up. The fruit of bondage worketh unto feare, and now all the hope is that a man setteth upon reformation; but if the Lord love a mans soule, he will not let him stay there, but goeth further with him, and sheweth him that his prayers and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:199237:108"/>are all empty and fall short of the life and power of Jesus Christ; but yet the soule is not quite out of hope, though the Law cannot save me, if it cannot, I must get me unto Jesus Christ, and lay hold upon him for salvation; as if all were to be had by faith in Jesus Christ, if once we can lay hold upon him, and nothing else were required but faith in Christ, and thereby my lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold upon him: I see plainly (saith a man in this case) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat there is no hope in me, as hath been rightly observed, and therefore He trust upon <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and give up my selfe to him: but now if the Lord love thy soule, he will not suffer thee there to rest, he will not leave thee so, He will presse thee further. How comest thou by faith in Christ? Why, thou tookest it up of thine owne accord, thou thoughtest all thy gifts and duties were in vaine, and therefore now thou wilt believe in Jesus Christ: Is it so easie a matter? Can any man come unto Christ except the Father draw him? And is thy faith any more than a resolution of thine owne, when thou wast convinced of the emptinesse of thine owne gifts and abilities?
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:199237:108"/>When this spirit of burning hath bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted this thy faith also, and that by the cleere evidence of the Gospel put upon it. Now saith the soule, I see that I am not in Christ, though I said that I would trust in Christ, yet I see, it is not every one that saith, <hi>Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdome of heaven.</hi> Now I see it is not my faith (such a Faith as mine is) that will reach Jesus Christ; it is not a faith of my own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking that will serve the turne. I see now Christ alone must worke this great worke in me, and Christ in the way of his owne Ordinances, therefore I must looke for it in his word, and in the fellowship of the Sacraments; therefore I will look up unto the Lord in all these, and waite for him, and seek him therein: And I hope I can seeke and waite in that way, though I can do nothing else, and so the poore soule maketh account that in time he shall finde Christ in the Ordinances, and so hammereth out a faith from thence, and therein blesseth himselfe. Now (minde you) the Spirit of God (when the Lord God the Father will draw home the soule throughly to Jesus
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:199237:109"/>Christ) will burne up all thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for if thy soule be not utterly lost, so long as it hath any roote, or power in it selfe, it is not come to an utter selfe-deniall; though I cannot worke I will believe, and if I cannot believe, I can waite that I may believe, and so here is still the old roote of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> left alive in us, whereby men seeke to establish their owne righteousnesse. This old roote putteth forth it selfe, and will not suffer the soule to be wholly <hi>from</hi> Christ and <hi>for</hi> Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and all because there is a sprigge of <hi>Adam</hi> left in the soule; whence it is, that the soule is marvellously apt to have hope and confidence more or lesse from some vertue or power in himselfe, therefore its no small matter to be cut off from <hi>Adam;</hi> thats contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; As faith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24. this is a marvellous strong work, when the Spirit of God comes to act things contrary to nature; for nature is fully possessed, that what God commandeth, I am able to doe it: nature will not be perswaded to the contrary; If I heare God command any thing, I will doe it (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a carnall heart) and if I cannot
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:199237:109"/>do it, I will believe, and if I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I will waite, and I can waite that I may believe; this is still but nature: Now when the Lord cometh indeed to ingraffe us into Jesus Christ, this is quite contrary to nature. Why, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is it so contrary? I answer, whereas nature is active for it selfe, now it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that whereas a soul hath been stirring and busie in his owne strength, at length the Spirit of God, by the mighty power of his grace, being shed abroad into the soule, doth burn up root and branch, not onely the root of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Covenant, but all the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the root of the <hi>Wild Olive,</hi> by which we are fat and lively to all spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall work in our owne apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so that we work in our owne strength, untill the Lord come and cut us quite down, and make us to see that there is not the least good thought, as of our selves, and therefore unlesse the Lord be wonderfully gratious unto us, we cannot be saved, till it come unto this, the soule is not fit for Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Thus the Spirit of God may worke powerfully in the hearts of men, and burn up their root and branch, and this
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:199237:110"/>a spirit of burning may doe, and yet leave the soule in a damnable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ought I know, and such as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a soule may be in, and yet never come to enjoy saving fellowship with Jesus Christ; therefore as this is one arm of God stretched forth for the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his people, when he draweth them out of themselves, by a Spirit Of

            <p n="2">2 There is a further work of God in drawing us home throughly and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to Jesus Christ, when he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Spirit of Adoption, which reacheth beyond all the former work; he hath cut us off from our selves, and now we stand in a state quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to nature, and if any saving work be wrought in us, it is quite contrary to nature; if any thing fall upon the heart and soule of a man, to bring his will to this passe, to lye downe at Gods feet, that he knoweth not what to doe, and yet whatsoever the Lord calleth him unto, he is willing, if it were possible to be done, he would run through fire and water to doe it: but he findeth himselfe unable to doe any
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:199237:110"/>thing, and now he will tell you that to <hi>believe</hi> is as impossible for him as to build a world: why then bid him wait, waite? saith he, I, but I cannot waite, and if I seek the Lord, I cannot find him, and I see others of Gods servants wrought upon gratiously, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This Spirit of Adoption doth give a man a Son<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now this stooping of the heart
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:199237:111"/>unto God, and yielding unto him to doe with us as seemeth good in his own eyes, is such a prostration of the heart, wherein the Lord hath taken possession of the soule, that now a man is led un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fellowship with Christ, that there is <hi>None in Heaven but him, none in the earth in comparison of him that the soule desireth after;</hi> and now a man waiteth upon Christ to see what he will doe for him; and though he cannot tell you that he waiteth, yet he doth waite, that he may be helped of God, to depend upon him.

               </gap>awing of the soule, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be <hi>the hearing and learning of the Father,</hi> of which <hi>John</hi> speaketh, <hi>ch.</hi> 6.45 <hi>He that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me;</hi> which is, when the Lord hath drawne the soule out of his naturall corruptions, legall reformations, pretences of Faith, and waiting upon Christ in his owne strength for Faith, if it be wanting: Then when the soul doth lie at his feet to be disposed of according to the will of God, and is in some measure subject unto the Lord, though not so much as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:199237:111"/>he could desire; and therefore now the soule doth not content or blesse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in any gifts or works of his own, but yieldeth himselfe humbly to the Lord, to work in him both will and deed of his owne good pleasure, and to teach him how to seek, and waite, and believe, and long after Jesus Christ, these things he waiteth for: Otherwise untill he be thus taught of God, the soule will alwayes think that he can doe something; and is not able to come out of himself to utter denyall of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; but if any man will come unto Christ, he must deny himselfe, even all his owne gifts, and parts, and good works whatsoever; for a man is never utterly denyed, untill there be nothing left of which a man can say, This I am able to doe, or this is an hopefull thing in me; and when it cometh to this passe, then will the soule lie down at the will of God, and acknowledge, that if the Lord would never shew him mercy, just and righteous are his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now when the soule and will of a Christian are convinced of these things, as well as his judgement, that now he waiteth upon Christ as well
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:199237:112"/>that he may be able to waite and seek the Lord, as he doth for any other good thing from the Lord, he waiteth now upon the Lord for a poor spirit, and cannot perke up himselfe, no more then a bruised Reed can doe. Thus when it cometh unto saving work, the will and soule of a man is so cast downe, that a man cannot tell what to make of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but there he lieth to see what the Lord will doe with him, whether he will reach forth the hand of salvation unto him or no. In this case the soule is left utterly void, and hath in himself neither root nor branch, but seeth how unable he is in himselfe to beleeve or waite; nor can he tell whether Jesus Christ be his portion, and now doth the Lord take possession, and fill the empty soule.</p>
            <p>If you ask me how this spirit cometh into the soule to make it thus to stoop unto Christ?</p>
            <p>You shall find that the Lord useth to convey himselfe unto the soule in some word of Promise of the Gospel that sheweth unto the soule the riches of the grace of God in Jesus Christ; something or other is declared of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:199237:112"/>Christ. This word being taught in the publick Ministry of the word, or brought to remembrance in some spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall duty, as Prayer, or Conference, or the like, (fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I will not limit the Holy One of <hi>Israel</hi>) yet usually it is done in the Ministry of the Gospel; and though the Lord doth not limit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, yet he doth limit us to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the means which he usually work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by; but whatsoever the way be, this is the manner of Gods working, he doth universally come into the soul in some word or other of his grace; as for instance, that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. or that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. In some such word of his grace he cometh and putteth life into the soule, and maketh it somwhat quiet, and causeth it to see that there is hope in <hi>Israel,</hi> and the Lord is able, and there is riches enough in Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o save me. By such kind of work it is that the Lord bringeth the soules of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants effectually to Christ, and now hath God the Father given us unto him, and untill now thou never camest unto him savingly. This is the second Act whereby God the Father giveth himselfe unto the soule.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:199237:113"/>
            <p> The third act or work followeth both these, as soone as ever the Lord hath given this selfe-denying spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soule, and hath made it like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bruised Reed, or like a Traveller that is out of his way, and willing to take any man by the hand that will lead him into his way againe; when the soule is in such a frame, the Lord cometh with a third act of Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The first work was of <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the second of <hi>Prostration,</hi> the third of <hi>Reconciliation.</hi> This is the third work of the Father, though there is in all these works a concurrence of the whole <hi>Trinity,</hi> yet some are more proper unto each Person, as our Catechismes teach us, and we are not wont to scruple such expressions in them. God the Father created us, and we cannot expound it; but as God the Father created us at the first, so he doth again create you, or else if we acknowledg it in the one, and not in the other, we do wrong unto God, even to the Father. Well, he is then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto us, having given unto us the Spirit of his Son; &amp; now he doth pronounce us reconciled unto him, this is the work which is spoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:199237:113"/>10. and this is the work of God the Father, according to that was before alledged, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world,</hi> &amp;c. Now there are two acts of God as fruits that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hereupon, and both of them done at once upon the soule.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The first is <hi>Adoption,</hi> whereby he maketh us his Children, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 1.12. So that now we are the <hi>Brethren</hi> of Christ, and the <hi>Sons</hi> of the Eternall God; <hi>Adoption</hi> is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the work of the Father, but Christ being the naturall Son of God, we must be knit unto him, before we can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Sons.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The second is <hi>Justification,</hi> Rom. 8.33, 34. This is the Father<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> work, and it is principally attributed unto him to forgive our iniquities, and to make reconciliation in Christ Jesus. And look as it is in our naturall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so soon as ever we have received naturall life from <hi>Adam,</hi> we become the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his sin is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us: so it is in the new birth, as soon as ever the life of Christ is shed abroad into our hearts, so soon are we Heires of Christ, and the righteousness
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:199237:114"/>of the second <hi>Adam</hi> is imputed unto us now to our Justification, as the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> before was to our Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>1</label> The Doctrine it selfe is but an Use, but I desire that we may all of us apply it unto our selves. It will be a help to us for our <hi>Instruction,</hi> to Teach us how we came to saving fellowship with God in Jesus Christ, and wherein lieth our spirituall union with Christ, and how it is wrought and obtained; and this is necessary, for as it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by others, so we may now ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it from what we have heard, that there be 4 sorts of men that fall short of this union with Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1 You have some that blesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their naturall estate, it may be they are rich, and honourable among men: well, they blesse themselves in that estate, and will never goe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is another sort that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the danger of their naturall estate, they dare not rest there, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they fall upon Reformations, and so to duties of Humiliation, and such like, wherein they find (as they
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:199237:114"/>conceive)such a blessed change, and so much comfort as doth satisfie them: And indeed God doth comfort men in their Reformations, for God will have no man lose by him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2, 5. Hypocrites have their reward for their Alms and for their Prayers. <hi>Herod</hi> when he heard <hi>John, reformed many things, and heard him gladly, Mark</hi> 6.20. Here was a great change, and doubtlesse much comfort in that gladnesse, yet these men never had the work of God the Father, to burn up all that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any strength of their owne.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A third sort goe a step beyond these, they have been convinced that they went forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Reformation in their owne strength: they plainly see it, and discerne it, and therefore they know that it is impossible to be saved by the righteousnesse of the Law, and that it is not of works, neither of one kind, nor of another; they are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that Faith onely must doe the deed, and upon this ground they will take up Faith to believe in Christ for salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that Faith, which formerly they have pitched upon their good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they will now pitch upon Christ;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:199237:115"/>but still it is the same Faith, for the root is not yet burnt up, the old corruption still remaineth in them, and so here is your old faith still translated from one object to another; it was fastned before upon your duties and reformations, and now upon Christ (though by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-strength) and now a man is ready to plead and say, If God had not loved me, he would never have set me upon such reformations, nor have enlarged me with such comforts, if he had not been well pleased with me in Jesus Christ. And though I have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times burnt up touching my hope in reformation, yet I have translated my Faith to Jesus Christ; but how came you to doe that? Why, I saw my hopes in my owne reformation would not serve my turne, and therefore I believed in Jesus Christ, and now shall nothing draw me from him, nor pull me from my confidence, for I have built upon some word of God, and some Promise of his made unto such reformation as I have set upon, and is not this true Faith in Jesus Christ? This is far from true Faith, it is no other but a strong fallacy whereby the Devil doth cheat
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:199237:115"/>men, and in truth this Faith is but a Faith of a mans owne making (that I may so speak) it is no more than a spirit of Burning at the best, that hath burnt up his confidence in his owne works, and taught him to resolve in his judgment to believe on Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">4 There is a fourth sort also that fall far short of Christ too, and yet goe beyond all these; they goe beyond works, and beyond this Faith also w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> we have spoken of, which was not a lively Faith in Christ whereby we are justified, but men justifie themselves by it, God doth not justifie them. Now this fourth sort come plainly to see that their Faith is shaken, and they dare not look God in the face▪ to justifie the truth of their Faith before him; it is true, many an heavenly spirited man cannot tell what will become of him, nor can he tell whether his Faith be sound, but many an Hypocrite also is so far convinced, that he cannot tell what will become of him, nor can he say that his Faith is right, nor that he is able to believe: What saith the soule now in such a case as this? He will say, I see it is not my Reformation, nor
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:199237:116"/>my Faith that will serve the turn, what is it then? I see that now I must <hi>waite</hi> upon Christ that I may believe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him I must <hi>seek</hi> for helpe. Is not this soule in a state of everlasting fellowship with Christ? Truly this is tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> which the Lord many times bringeth the souls of his Servants unto, but he leaveth them not there, if he mean to doe them good; for I would examine again, how camest thou to <hi>waite</hi> upon Jesus Christ? thou hast been driven out of conceit of thy former Faith, and so hast been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and hast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:199237:116"/>there is no promise of life made to those that wait &amp; seek in their own strength, who being driven to it, have taken it up by their own <hi>resolutions;</hi> though I grant it is true, that every one that waiteth for, and seeketh the Lord aright, is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto it by the Lord, yet if ever the Lord mean to save you, he will rend, as it were the caule from the heart, I mean he will pluck away all the confidence you have built upon; a as man would rend the intralls of a Beast from him, so the Lord will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing you to a flat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of your selves, and that you have neither good will nor deed, as of your selves: And, you will find, you know not what God will doe with you, but this you know, that whatsoever he doth he is most righteous. When the Spirit of God cometh as a Comforter, he will in this manner convince the soul of a man that he hath heretofore hung upon his reformations for hope &amp; comfort, but now he is brought plainly to see and flatly to deny, that he hath so much as one drop of the fatnes of the true Olive tree in him, when he most trusted unto his own excellencies. Now a man being thus far brought on, doth not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:199237:117"/>himselfe in his judgement, but in his will, and is ready to say as <hi>David</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did, <hi>If the Lord say he hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in me, here I am, let him doe unto me as seemeth him good.</hi> The Lord is righteous in all that cometh upon me: this onely the soul hath for his support in such a case, the Lord is able to doe all for me that I stand in need of: If he shew me no mercy, he is just, if he be gratious I shall live to praise him. Now when a mans will is thus subdued, that he hath no will of his owne to be guided by, but onely the will of God; this is true bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse of heart, when not onely the judgement, but the heart and will is broken. The soule being thus convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that neither his working, nor believing, nor waiting, nor seeking, as of himselfe, will doe him any good, there is no mercy that he can chalenge for any goodnesse sake of his owne; then cometh the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in some declaration of Gods free love, and taketh possession of the heart, and then the soule beginneth to pant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jesus Christ, and nothing in Heaven but him, nor in the Earth besides him. The soule being thus wrought upon beginneth to put forth it selfe towards the Lord Jesus, but the Holy Ghost having taken possession before, <hi>helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> Rom. 8.26, 27. He alone must help us, and no other.</p>
